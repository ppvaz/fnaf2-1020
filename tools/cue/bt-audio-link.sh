# After a host reboot on 2026-09-15 the bond was intact on both sides and the
# link was down. `bluetoothctl connect` fails with le-connection-abort-by-local:
# the phone is dual-mode and bluetoothctl picks LE, while A2DP is a BR/EDR
# profile. Naming the profile works: org.bluez.Device1.ConnectProfile with the
# A2DP Source UUID brought the PCM up in under five seconds. That is the host
# side. When it does not (the phone can refuse an incoming profile connection),
# the phone side is Android's own Bluetooth settings: the paired host is listed
# by name under "Media devices", and a tap on it connects. Android exposes no
# shell command for a profile connection (`cmd bluetooth_manager` has only
# enable/disable), so the tap is found with `uiautomator dump`, never by fixed
# coordinates, and the app that was in front is restored afterwards.
#
# Menu-only device actions, and only with the game NOT the foreground window
# at the moment of the tap: this script never sends input to the game.
