"""Measure the bang detector's miss rate against visually labeled arrivals.

The miss rate is the only fatal direction for the bang-armed policy, and it
cannot be measured with the detector that is under test. So the label comes
from the other modality: the lit left opening is bright when empty and black
when Balloon Boy is in it, so a bright->dark transition in the projection
snapshot is a real g417 arrival, timestamped on the same monotonic clock the
audio log is anchored to.

  tools/cue/label-misses.py visual.tsv run1-*.wav --start-ns 95671421840625

The luma threshold is derived from the recording rather than assumed, because
the projection scaler's values have never been calibrated against the offline
simulation the published numbers came from. The split it finds is printed so it
can be sanity-checked before any rate is believed.
