# Injecting 52 copies of sample 17 into 159.5 s of real night background and
# scanning the result:
#
#   raw                     3 of 52 confirmed   (6% recall)
#   afftdn denoised        27 of 52 confirmed  (52% recall, 27/27 true, 0 false)
#
# The capture clips -- night 6-40's live stretch had peak pinned at full-scale
# int16 on 55% of snapshots, and `evaluate.py` refuses three of the six archived
# recordings outright as "unusable: clipped". Clipping is what the band stage
# survives and the correlation stage does not, so removing it is worth more than
# any threshold change.
#
# The detectability floor, same method, denoised:
#
#   injected at   0 dB -> 27/52      -6 dB -> 17/52
#               -12 dB ->  7/52     -18 dB ->  0/52
#
# So a zero here means "no bang above about -12 dB relative to background", NOT
# "no bang". Quote it that way.
