// The vent path: the one control this replay never exercises, and the reason
// the comparison above needs an EFFECT and not only a held button.
//
// Until 2026-09-09 this file compared `sim.lightHeld` -- the button -- and no
// derived term. plant-model.js's `anyOfficeLightHeld` was missing the view
// condition the dump gives g301/g303/g320 (`mask` = 0 AND `viewing` = 0), so
// the engine credited a vent light held with a camera up, and nothing here
// could have said so: the minus-toys queue above is
// ['cam:11','cam:9','light','mask','monitor','wind'] and contains no vent
// action at all. An unexercised path cannot disagree. So drive it directly.
//
// The reduced model is deliberately NOT held to the same predicate. It tracks
// ventLightL/R and reads them nowhere, and a held vent light costs no power in
// either model -- measured 7000 -> 7000 over 30 s, against 7000 -> 5200 for a
// held hall light in BOTH. What the two models are held to here is the button
// state and the compared fields; what Sim alone is held to is the sourced rule.
