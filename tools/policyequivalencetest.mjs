// stun -- `openStunLeadMs`/`openStunHoldMs`, one camera-feed hold in `open` and
// one in `opening`. That commit updated the emitter's own expected row and not
// this number, so the gate has read 183 against a 185-event plan ever since.
// It went unnoticed for nine days because this file was registered only in
// `tools/test.mjs`'s ENGINE group, which CI does not run and whose reds
// CLAUDE.md excuses as intentional scientific controls. It is a
// compiler-equivalence regression gate, not a control, so it is now in
// `npm run test:unit` as well -- mistake register entry 13.
