// What a reduction in actuator lateness would be worth, and where the knee is.
//
// plans/PROGRESS.md named launch lateness the only lever left on the 10/20
// mission after policy, recovery and perception were each exonerated. That
// makes one question decisive before anyone touches the phone: **is the mean
// worth reducing, and by how much before anything changes?** If halving it
// buys nothing the line of work stops here; if there is a knee, the knee is
// the device target.
//
// Every number this file prints is a SIMULATOR number. It prices the
// `hidpilot n6 target` pilot through `tools/device/actuator.mjs`, which models
// launch lateness and the mask seam and nothing else -- not the runner's
// blocking shell, not the classifier's tail, not `screenrecord` contention.
// The actuator's own header says survival under it is still survival in a
// model. Read a row as "how this route responds to lateness", never as "the
// phone would clear night 6".
//
// Two controls make the rows readable rather than merely favourable:
//
//   * The zero row must reproduce the exact figure (200/200 every night). A
//     lateness sweep whose zero end is not the unwrapped result is measuring
//     its own wrapper.
//   * The 110-300 ms row must reproduce plans/12's published table
//     (23/200 on night 1, 0/200 on nights 2-7). Both are asserted under
//     `--assert`, so a cell that drifts fails rather than being re-read.
//
// The mean and the spread are swept SEPARATELY because they are different
// device quantities with different fixes: the mean is what a phase offset
// could in principle absorb, the spread is what `wait_until` re-rolls at every
// wall-timed boundary. `actuator.mjs`'s header claims the mean is nearly free
// and the spread does the damage; plans/12 already found that false on this
// route, and the mean sweep below says why.
//
