// Simulator pilot for comparing stock-Android HID timing experiments.
//
// The regular device pilot is constrained by `adb shell input swipe`, whose
// helper takes about 170 ms per press on the test phone. Android's `hid -`
// command can instead feed one persistent virtual touchscreen. The verified
// hybrid report holds contact 0 on the camera light while contact 1 gets a
// fresh down/up on each camera; see docs/device/HID-MULTITOUCH.md.
//
// This file's CAM 05 policy is retained as a comparison, not the selected
// Night 6 controller. The intended device route spends HID's saved time on the
// validated lit-left-opening classifier. Likewise, `--no-cam5` removes all BB
// handling; it is a negative control, not a model of that left-opening route.
