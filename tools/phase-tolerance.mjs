// WHAT A NUMBER FROM HERE IS. A statement about the model, and nothing else.
// It is not gameplay evidence, it is not a device claim, and it does not move
// a rung of Plan 12's ladder.
// In particular, sigma=29 is NOT a measured command-to-app distribution:
// minus-toys-jitter.mjs sourced it from driver per-anchor residuals. This IID
// Gaussian, nearest-frame experiment does not identify the phone's error
// correlation, game-poll phase, clock drift, or effective input latency.
//
// ------------------------------------------------------------ why it exists
//
// `--slack` in either family's `cycle.mjs` perturbs the routine IID PER ROW:
// every row of every cycle draws its own independent error, so a night takes
// roughly 8 x 84 = 670 draws. Under that model both families collapse at
// +/-1 frame (Minus 7 422/3000, Minus Toys 172/3000). That is easy to read as
// "the strategy is impossibly tight", and it is not what it says, because it
// is not the executor a human is:
//
//   * IID per row destroys the RELATIVE spacing inside a cycle, which is where
//     the routine's safety lives (press, MASK_ANIM_ON + 301, release). A human
//     runs the cycle as one motor program and the gaps survive.
//   * 670 independent draws compound over a night. A human re-anchors to the
//     game's own clock every interval (MINUS-7-STRATEGY.md §1's mandatory
//     timer), so the error does not accumulate across cycles.
//
// The human error is COMMON MODE: the whole cycle sits k frames off the
// interval with its internal gaps intact. So is the error of an executor whose
// dispatch latency is stable but unknown -- which is the question that decides
// whether the external device route is reachable at all. The two models
// disagree by more than an order of magnitude, so quote the one that matches
// the executor being argued about, and say which it is.
//
// NEITHER MODEL ALONE IS A DEVICE NUMBER, and the two are orthogonal rather
// than rival. Decompose a real executor's timing error into (a) a common-mode
// offset of the whole cycle against the interval and (b) residual per-row
// scatter around it. `--slack` sweeps (b) with (a) pinned at zero -- note that
// every row is scheduled from `w0`, the TRUE interval, so it also assumes a
// perfect clock and models neither a wrong epoch nor drift. `--kmax` sweeps
// (a) with (b) pinned at zero, which is a perfectly repeatable hand that is
// consistently late. A phone has both at once: an epoch bracket and drift on
// (a), dispatch jitter on (b). `--slack` together with the k sweep prints the
// joint map, which is the only one of the three that can be compared against a
// measured handset.
//
// The asymmetry between them is mechanical, not a curiosity: the routine's
// margins live in the GAPS between rows, so a common-mode shift slides every
// gap along intact until one walks off a cliff, while per-row scatter attacks
// every gap at once and gets ~670 attempts a night.
//
// The families differ only in WHICH cycle rows are absolute offsets from the
// interval, so that is the only family-specific thing here and it is data.

// A DISPATCH-LATENCY model, because neither sweep above can express the range a
// handset actually lives in. `--slack` quantizes to frames as
// `span = round(slackMs * FPS / 1000)`, so under about 8 ms it is no jitter at
// all and from 8 to 25 ms it is a uniform draw over three frames -- two rows in
// three land on the wrong frame. The model can say p = 0 or p = 2/3 and nothing
// between, and the published "collapses at one frame" figure is the 2/3 end:
// not a demanding executor, a broken one.
//
// What a measured handset yields is a latency distribution, so that is what
// this takes. Each row is dispatched at its intended time plus a draw from
// N(mean, sigma) in ms, and the engine being frame-quantized turns that into a
// frame shift. The slip probability falls out rather than being assumed, and it
// is reported next to survival so a measured sigma converts directly.
//
// The draws are hashed from (seed, row, win) rather than taken from a running
// stream, so a cell is reproducible and independent of evaluation order. The
// game's own LCG is deliberately NOT used: it carries 16 bits of state and a
// period of 16384, which is faithful for reproducing the source's rolls and
// wrong for generating statistics about them.
