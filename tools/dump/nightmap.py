"""Read a night out of a rendered CTFAK event sheet, for any of the four games.

`aimap.py` answers one question about one game: FNaF 2's per-night AI counter
table. This answers the same class of question about *whatever sheet it is
pointed at*, which is what makes a second, third and fourth game's night
modellable without a bespoke parser each time.

The sheet format is the CTFAK-rendered one, produced by `dump_events.py`:

    --- group N ---
      IF   <condition>
      DO   <action>

Every line in all four games' dumps is one of: a group header, an `IF`, a `DO`,
a `FRAME` header, its `====` underline, or blank. Nothing wraps, so the parse
is a split rather than a grammar -- see `--audit`, which prints any line the
reader could not classify. An empty audit is the claim that nothing was
silently dropped.

Reports (each also available as `--json`):

  --table       the per-night / per-hour difficulty table
  --clock       the night clock: what ticks, what rolls over, what wins
  --rolls       movement rolls: `Every N ms` + `Random(B)+1 <= <counter>`
  --graph OBJ   an object's movement graph: overlap source -> position target
  --draws       every `Random` draw, with whether a timer forces it
  --timers      every distinct `Every` / `TimerEquals` period
  --audit       unclassified lines (should be empty)

Usage:

    tools/dump/nightmap.py --game fnaf1 --table
    tools/dump/nightmap.py --sheet path/to/03-04-Office.txt --clock --json
    tools/dump/nightmap.py --game fnaf4 --graph Bonnie

`--game` resolves a sheet through `$FNAF_DUMP_ROOT` (default `~/fnaf-apks`),
whose per-game `events/` directories hold extracted game content and stay
outside the repository. `--sheet` takes a path directly.

The counter names each game uses for its night and hour are *not* guessed from
a convention -- FNaF 4's is `Night` where FNaF 1's is `night number`, and a
lowercase-only query finds nothing in FNaF 4 while looking exactly like an
absence. They are named per game in GAMES below, and `--clock` derives the
clock chain structurally so that a wrong name shows up as a missing chain
rather than as a plausible wrong number.

    A draw a timer forces is consumed whether or not anything happens, so a

    predicting a stream.

    Where the draw sits decides this, and it is not the same question for the
    two sites:

    - A draw in an **action** runs only if every condition passed.
    - A draw in a **condition** is evaluated while the conditions are being
      tested, and Clickteam stops at the first that fails. So a `Random`
      inside a movement roll's own comparison is consumed as soon as the
      timer fires *if nothing before it can fail* -- which is why
      `conditionsBefore` counts the non-timer conditions that precede the
      drawing line rather than the group's conditions as a whole.

    `forcedByTimer` is therefore true when a timer gates the group and
    nothing that can fail stands in front of the draw.
