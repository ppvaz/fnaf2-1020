# Source-dump tools

Read [`SOURCE-DUMP-GUIDE.md`](../../docs/android/SOURCE-DUMP-GUIDE.md) before
using or citing these. The extracted CCN and event dump are copyrighted game
content and must remain outside the repo. The labels are defined in
[`../README.md`](../README.md); the censuses checked against these readers are
listed there too.

| Tool | Kind | Purpose and interface |
|---|---|---|
| `tools/dump/regen-dump.sh APPLICATION.CCN [outfile]` | extraction | Runs a CTFAK build in the .NET 6 Docker image and writes the event text dump. Configure `CTFAK_SRC`, `CTFAK_IMAGE`, and/or `DUMP_DIR` as needed; `CTFAK_IMAGE_DIR` + `CTFAK_IMAGE_HANDLES` also export named images as PNG (needs the `tools/dump/ctfak-gdiplus.Dockerfile` image). |
| `tools/dump/ctfak-gdiplus.Dockerfile` | extraction | The .NET 6 SDK image plus libgdiplus, for the dumper's PNG export. Build it once and pass it as `CTFAK_IMAGE`. |
| `tools/dump/EventTextDumper.cs` | CTFAK plugin source | CTFAK `IFusionTool` used by `regen-dump.sh` to serialize objects, frames, conditions, actions, and parameters. It is not a standalone command. |
| `tools/dump/extract-samples.sh APK [outdir] [handle ...]` | query | Extracts reference cue samples from the game APK by Fusion sample handle (`res/raw/sNNNN.*`). Game content: it refuses to write anywhere inside the repository, and only derived reports are committed. |
| `tools/dump/readdump.py` | query | Resolves Android's XOR-28 object handles and provides `frames`, `objects`, `group`, `find`, `object`, `writes`, and `sounds` queries. `sounds <frame>` indexes every play-sample action by handle so a cue's uniqueness is visible; `sounds <frame> <handle>` prints the groups that play one. Sounds are dispatched through `cam 01` registers, so pair it with `writes` to reach the real trigger. Use `--xor 0` for old PC dumps and `--dump`/`FNAF2_DUMP` for the source file. |
| `tools/dump/coverage.py` | report | Classifies all event groups and cross-references citations to expose unread state/setup/input clusters. `--map` prints the full Markdown map; `--dump` and `--frame` select input. |
| `tools/dump/aimap.py [event-sheet]` | report | Replays the per-night/per-hour AI counter table. Reads the canonical tabular dump (`$FNAF2_DUMP`) or an archived rendered `03-04-Office.txt` (`$FNAF2_OFFICE_DUMP`), detected by content. `--json` emits structured output; `--xor 0` reads PC dumps. |
| `tools/dump/test-instances.py` | check | Checks the frame-instance reader against a synthetic dump. Needs no game content. |
| `tools/dump/nightmap.py --game <g>` | report | Reads a night out of any of the four rendered event-sheet dumps: `--table` the per-night/per-hour difficulty table, `--clock` the night clock chain, `--rolls` the movement rolls, `--graph OBJ` / `--graphs` an object's movement edges, `--draws` the draw census with which draws a timer forces, `--timers`, and `--audit` (any line the parse could not classify; empty on all four sheets). `--json` for structured output. `$FNAF_DUMP_ROOT` locates the dumps, which stay outside the repository. |
| `tools/dump/test-nightmap.py` | check | Runs `nightmap.py` over a synthetic sheet: both operand orders of `base + Random(b)`, the one-in-D form, counter-valued sets, an alterable-value clock accumulator, a roll, a movement edge, and an unclassifiable line that must be audited rather than swallowed. Needs no game content. |
| `tools/dump/test-aimap.py` | check | Runs `aimap.py` over a synthetic sheet in both forms: night-start zeroing, per-hour carry-forward, `<`/`>` night comparisons, Random assignments, and the Custom Night dial copy. Needs no game content. |
