// 878 vs 877, mute 2227 vs 2226, newGame 778 vs 777, continue 978 vs 977): the
// probe that measured what the phone accepts sent a coordinate the runner never
// sent. The shell and Python copies left with the legacy lane on 2026-09-25 and
// hid-sweep-probe.mjs now re-exports the transport's function, so two remain:
//
//   packages/adapters/src/transports/hid.js   Math.floor   the campaign executor
//   android/.../NightRunner.java              int /        the Companion's runner
//
// The transport is the authority: it is what presses the phone.
