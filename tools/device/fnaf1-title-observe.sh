# `menu.sh` deliberately defaults TITLE_MODEL to FNaF 2's model because it is
# the FNaF 2 selector.  That default is unsafe for any other game: FNaF 1 and
# FNaF 2 share versionName 2.0.7 but not title geometry.  This wrapper removes
# any inherited TITLE_MODEL and passes FNaF 1's model explicitly, so omission
# cannot silently select the FNaF 2 sensor.
