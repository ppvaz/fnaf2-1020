// The repository is rich in written knowledge and poor in REACHABLE knowledge.
// Five times on 2026-09-11 a decision was made in one place while the fact that
// governed it sat in another: a measurement in a comment, a band table a tool
// already computed, a negative recorded in PROGRESS, a gate in a lane CI never
// runs, and -- the one this file exists for -- a better classifier for a fact
// the executor was answering with a worse one.
//
// `tools/device/intersection-state-gate.mjs` consumes the Cue Helper's native
// button downstroke scores and states its discipline plainly: "fitted grid
// anchors are a diagnostic fallback only" and "a missing stroke score is a
// refusal, never a luma fallback". `apps/device/src/modern-campaign-ports.js`
// answers the same maskOn question from the 20x9 grid and, when that returns
// null, falls back to exactly the luma refutation the other file forbids. Both
// were in the tree for weeks. Nothing compared them, because nothing was
// looking at facts -- only at files.
//
// So this registers the FACT, not the file: every producer of a semantic state,
// the evidence each decides on, and every consumer. `test-fact-register.mjs`
// then refuses a fact whose consumers disagree about which producer to trust.
// That disagreement is the signature of gold sitting under the project's nose.
