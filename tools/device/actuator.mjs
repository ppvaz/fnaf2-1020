// The phone, between a pilot's schedule and the game.
//
// The exact simulator delivers every press on its scheduled frame and refuses
// only what the GAME refuses (engine.js press()). The device adds two failure
// modes of its own, both measured, and a schedule that survives without them
// has not been priced against the phone:
//
// - **Launch lateness.** Every wall-timed press lands late: the anchor press's
//   own lateness was 110-180 ms in the older traces and ~300 ms on night 6-40
//   (ON-DEVICE-VALIDATION.md). The mean is nearly free -- shifting the whole
//   route late survives up to 100 ms and the epoch offset dials it out -- but
//   the SPREAD costs nights (HID-MULTITOUCH.md: +/-10 ms of jitter drops
//   300/300 to 204/300). So `worst` mode does not pin lateness to the maximum:
//   a uniformly-late schedule is the benign case, and pinning would delete the
//   spread that does the damage.
//
//   **Re-scoped 2026-08-26, and the original is kept because the `worst`-mode
//   decision still rests on it.** On the HID route the mean is NOT nearly free
//   and the spread is not the lever: `tools/latenesssweep.mjs` finds a uniform
//   205 ms is 0/200 on Nights 2-7 at any spread from +/-0 to +/-95, and halving
//   it to 110 or 83 changes nothing. Both readings are the same statement once
//   the frame quantisation below is taken seriously -- what costs nights is
//   total displacement in FRAMES, and 205 ms is 12 of them before any spread.
//   The real budget is two frames (41 ms) of per-anchor error, uniform or not;
//   the shipped `date`-based `wait_until` delivers 3-6 (49-106 ms, device probe
//   2026-08-26) and a fork-free `/proc/uptime` loop delivers 0-1. The `worst`
//   decision stands unchanged: pinning to the maximum still deletes the
//   cycle-to-cycle displacement that does the damage.
//
//   The band below is also NOT press-to-effect lateness. Every figure in it
//   stops at the shell -- see plans/12, "The lateness bands, decomposed and
//   priced" -- so the coprocess write, UHID, InputReader and Fusion's own poll
//   are outside it, bounded at roughly one frame and not measured.
//
// - **The mask seam.** While the mask is up or coming off, the monitor bar is
//   not drawn, so a monitor press there has no control under it. The engine
//   already refuses presses while the mask is ON; what only the phone loses is
//   the press during the mask-OFF animation, because setMask(false) clears
//   maskOn on the press and the animation runs as decoration. Measured across
//   the 28 graded nights (ON-DEVICE-VALIDATION.md "Which press desyncs, and
//   why", 2026-08-25): under 140 ms after the mask press 5 of 7 monitor
//   presses were lost, at 140-180 ms 4 of 8, and at 180 ms or more 0 of 17.
//
// Presses go through one queue, like the hid coprocess pipe (and the swipe
// era's sequential helper launches): order in is order out, so a press can
// land no earlier than the press before it. A backlog therefore delays a
// hold's release too -- that is the queue draining, not an error model
// corrupting flash lengths. Within one submission the press and its release
// share a single lateness draw, because plans/04 showed that independent
// draws turn every flash into a random length and price nothing.
//
// Measured but deliberately NOT modelled, because neither has a clean rate:
// the monitor press lost while a wind contact was still held (3 of 32
// readable, a geometry the runner no longer schedules), and the vent-light
// press drop ("dropped often enough to matter" -- no denominator yet). Add
// them here when a run census gives them numbers, not before.

// `trial-minus7.sh`'s monitor loop, and only that.
//
// WHAT IT MODELS -- every step is a line in the runner:
//
//   1. The flip gate (`light_down_at`). Immediately before the vent light goes
//      down, wait `MONITOR_ANIM_DOWN_MS` from the anchor's LOGGED monitor
//      press, read the cue helper, and -- if it says the cams are up -- read it
//      once more, because "one sample cannot tell a flash from the cams". Two
//      agreeing reads press the monitor again and push the light-down out past
//      the corrective flip. Both reads cost time, and the shell is blocking, so
//      the cost lands on the rest of the cycle.
//   2. The classifier checkpoint (`monitor_seen` / `cams=UP-DESYNCED`). The
//      frame the BB model already captured is asked a second question. A
//      camera-feed frame means the anchor's lowering press did not take, so:
//      lower, wait the flip out, read the cue back, lower once more if it is
//      still up, then resume the cycle from a floor with the branch's mask-off
//      press SKIPPED (`MASK_ALREADY_OFF` -- there is no mask on to take off,
//      and pressing would put one on and blind every later read).
//   3. `desyncs -le 12`, then exit 48. An abort is not a survival.
//
// WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT MODEL, because the runner cannot do it:
//
//   - **The loop is one-directional.** Both checkpoints ask "are the cams up
//     when they should be down". Nothing in the runner ever asks the opposite,
//     so a forcedown that lowers the monitor mid-sweep is invisible until it
//     produces a cams-up at the NEXT read. No `--sync`-style bidirectional
//     resync is available here, and adding one would model a controller that
//     does not exist.
//   - **It looks twice a cycle and nowhere else.** Between the read and the
//     next cycle's flip gate the runner is blind, so a monitor raise lost
//     inside the branch macro stands for the rest of the cycle.
//   - **It reads a state, not a parity.** The cue answers "are the cameras on
//     screen", exactly as the helper does; it never learns which press was
//     dropped.
//   - Classifier accuracy itself. The pilot's BB read stays whatever the pilot
//     models; `errorRate` here perturbs only the MONITOR observation, and only
//     as a control.
//   - The `nolight` / `unknown` streak branches, the cue helper's stale-frame
//     age, and the 1-3% parasite read stalls. None has a rate this model could
//     honour.
//   - One known optimism, stated so it is not mistaken for a result: when the
//     gate corrects, the phone's vent light lands ~500 ms late and the
//     classifier's frame is taken out of position -- which is what produced the
//     `bbinside` and `unknown` misreads before `READ_CAPTURE_DELAY_MS` was
//     re-anchored. The wrapped pilot's BB answer is ground truth regardless of
//     where the light was, so the model charges the correction its time and not
//     its blindness. The reclaim below is therefore an upper bound on this
//     loop, not a floor.
