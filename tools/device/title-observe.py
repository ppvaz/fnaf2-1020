"""Report which title-screen items are visible, or why that is unknown.

The title screen is the one place the runners have always acted blind. Four
scripts tap a coordinate for `Continue` or `6th Night` without ever asking
whether that item is on screen; `TAP_NEWGAME` sits in `coords.sh` beside them,
unused and unguarded, one edit away from erasing the save. plans/13 makes the
menu an observation instead: nothing is tapped that was not seen.

    screencap -p | title-observe.py            # items=continue,newGame
    title-observe.py --adb                     # capture and classify
    title-observe.py --measure < frame.png     # the raw fractions, for calibration
    title-observe.py --continue-night < frame.png   # night=5, for a model with continue_subtitle

Output is exactly one line on stdout:

    items=<comma-separated MenuTargets>   a confident read   (exit 0)
    unknown=<reason>                      refuse             (exit 3)

`models/title-moto-g56-v207.json` is the measured model for the canonical build
on the calibrated handset (2026-08-26, 26 frames). Its numbers, with their
control:

    band                     newGame        continue       sixthNight
    title, fresh save (23)   0.0674-0.1318  0.0264-0.0547  0.0000 exactly
    title, 6th unlocked (3)  0.0690-0.0720  0.0310-0.0330  0.0670-0.0690
    office HUD (control)     0.0000         0.0000         0.0000

Absent is not "small", it is exactly zero across every frame measured, and the
narrowest present value is 0.0264 -- so the thresholds sit at 0.008/0.020 with
the interval between them meaning "undecided", never "probably absent".

The gate exists because of the Options screen. Its "Perspective Effect" label
lands inside the New Game band at 0.0186, against a 0.020 present threshold: a
margin of 0.0014, which is not a classifier. So the item bands are consulted
only after the game logo says this is the title screen at all -- the word "Five"
reads 0.106-0.123 on every title frame measured and 0.007-0.012 on Options.

With no `TITLE_MODEL` this prints `unknown=no-title-model` and the selector
refuses. To calibrate a different handset or build, run `--measure` over frames
of each save state and set thresholds that separate them, with the undecided
interval kept wide enough to be useful.
`tools/device/testdata/make-title-fixture.py` builds the synthetic equivalent
that `test-menu.sh` uses to exercise every branch here without a phone --
synthetic frames prove the plumbing, never the threshold.

Exit codes: 0 confident, 3 unknown/refuse, 2 usage or I/O failure.
