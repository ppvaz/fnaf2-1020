# Run every instrument this repository owns against one run, and print one
# verdict.
#
# The problem this fixes is not a missing instrument. It is that we have a
# drawer full of them -- camtrace, sweepcheck, windpct, grade-minus7,
# screenstate, the HID trace auditor, the screen-model replay -- and nothing
# that runs them. So each has to be remembered, and what is not remembered is
# not checked.
#
# It cost a false record. Night 6-36 was reported at 163 s and night 6-37 at 153 s,
# both "past 2 AM". The retained frames later showed a restart card, the death
# static and the "Take cake to the children" minigame inside those intervals:
# the game had died around 70 s and the pilot kept pressing. screenstate.py
# would have said so on any of those frames. Nobody ran it.
#
# The runner did have GRADE_RUN=1. It graded "$OUT.mp4" -- and every run that
# ends in an abort saves "$OUT-aborted.mp4" instead, so for the whole of that
# session the grading step ran against a file that did not exist and said
# nothing. A pipeline that silently grades nothing is worse than no pipeline,
# because it looks like coverage.
#
# Usage: grade-run.sh RUN_NAME [--require-seconds N]
#   RUN_NAME is night-run.sh's run id, e.g. night7-k3-cohort-r01-20260918T030258Z.
#
# It grades what a night-run.sh attempt retains: the recording, the campaign
# directory, and the Perfetto input and Cue Helper frame traces when the run
# asked for them. The legacy trial.sh lane's inputs -- its HID trace, session
# manifest, driver log, cue trace and receiver PCM -- left with that lane on
# 2026-09-25 (docs/ARCHIVED-ROUTES.md).
