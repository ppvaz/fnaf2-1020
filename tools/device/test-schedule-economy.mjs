// A schedule must not answer an empty building, and its hands-off claim must be
// derivable rather than asserted.
//
// Two ends of a night, both of which were prose until 2026-09-19:
//
// PREFIX. `idleUntilMs` returns the EARLIER of "the box drains" and "a threat
// can act". That is the right answer to "when must the pilot be awake at all"
// and the wrong answer to "when must the full cycle start", and the two
// coincide only on Night 1. From Night 2 up the box drains from hour 0, so
// `idleUntilMs` collapses to 0 and the emitted plan opens its full cycle at
// t=0 -- against a roster that `aiUpdates(night, 0)` says is empty. On the
// shipped Night 2 minus-toys plan that is 53 contacts in the first in-game
// hour, 7 of them wind and 46 answering nobody: 14 mask presses, 7 held
// camera-light flashes charged to a finite flashlight budget, 7 hall pulses
// for a Foxy who arms an hour later. Each is also a press the phone can lose.
//
// SUFFIX. `minStopAtMs = 360000` carries the comment "~5:08 AM: no route can
// reach the office before 6". Nothing derived it and nothing checked it. The
// box half of that claim IS derivable -- BOX_UNITS at BOX_DRAIN_PER_TICK per
// BOX_DRAIN_TICK_MS -- so this refuses a minimal schedule that stops winding
// later than a full box can survive. The animatronic half stays
// UNKNOWN(not-derived): after the box empties the Puppet still has
// PUPPET_ESCAPE_STAGES stages and a five-position route, and Foxy, Balloon Boy
// and the Withereds have their own last-moment that nothing here computes.
