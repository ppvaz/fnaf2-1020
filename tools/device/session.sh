# Sourced, never executed. `session-manifest.py` owns the file format; this
# owns the *threading*: the id is latched once by `fnaf_session_begin` and
# exported, so a helper started inside a run joins that run's manifest instead
# of inventing a second identity from a filename. That is the whole point --
# Plan 09 package 1 found artifacts that shared a basename and nothing else.
#
# Failure policy. Beginning a session may abort the caller: a run that cannot
# describe itself must not go on to collect evidence nobody can replay. Once
# the phone is live, a recording failure must NOT kill the night -- it marks
# the session faulted, says so on stderr, and finalize reports it. What is
# never allowed is a step that fails quietly and reads as coverage.
#
# Set FNAF2_MANIFEST=0 to disable recording entirely. That is for tooling that
# is testing something else; a device run that sets it produces evidence with
# no provenance, which is the state this plan exists to end.
