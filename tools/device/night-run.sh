# One command per device attempt, any night: record, run, reconstruct, reset.
# (Named night5-run.sh until 2026-09-13; it drove Nights 5 and 6 alike.)
#
# Every previous attempt was assembled by hand across two terminals (PROGRESS,
# 2026-09-11): start `screenrecord`, run the campaign, stop the recording, pull
# it, hash it, run `phase-reconstruct.mjs`, run `run-timeline.py`, then drive
# the phone back to the title. Six manual steps is six ways to lose an attempt,
# and mistake-register entry 6 says every aborted attempt leaves the game
# mid-night. This script is that sequence with the failure handling attached:
#
#   - fail-fast: every input path, the serial, and every downstream tool are
#     checked for EXISTENCE before the phone is touched (mistake 5: a wrong
#     tool path failed silently behind `&& echo` twice).
#   - fail-safe: an EXIT trap always stops the recording, always pulls what was
#     captured, and always drives the game back to an OBSERVED title, whether
#     the campaign passed, failed, or the operator killed it.
#
# Usage:
#   tools/device/night-run.sh --label baseline [--bundle DIR] [--night N]
#                              [--serial ID] [--calibration FILE] [--no-video] [--no-grade]

# Pedro's standing direction: the arm check does not block the schedule.
#
# It is not a preference, it is the difference between a winnable night and an
# unwinnable one. In `blocking` mode the executor parks the HID stream at the
# end of the opening prefix, waits ARM_SETTLE_MS (600) plus at least one more
# 250 ms poll for a second agreeing read, and then delivers EVERY later press
# that much late -- `phaseLagMs` in adb-device-local-executor.js. The two
# retained 2026-09-11 runs measured 1320 ms and 6695 ms of it.
#
# observe-once starts the schedule first and observes alongside it, so it adds
# no suffix shift at all. That is worth having, but it is NOT by itself a phase
# fix, and nothing here should be read as one: the model's response to
# delivered phase is banded over each 1000 ms game second -- night 5 loses on
# [116.67,166.67), [316.67,366.67), [416.67,800) and [916.67,966.67) -- and the
# night origin is bracketed wider than that whole period (1852 ms on the
# 2026-09-12 run). Until the origin is pinned the delivered phase is
# effectively uniform, which is the model's own 1375/3000 uncontrolled-phase
