// Gate for the device-proven Minus 3 frame-light recipe. No phone required.
//
// The recipe in minus3-frame-light.mjs is the schedule that cleared story
// Nights 3 and 4 on the Moto g56. Until it was written down it existed only as
// an inline schedule in a one-off runner under a gitignored artifacts
// directory: a `rm -rf artifacts/` would have deleted the only copy of the
// thing that won. This checks the three ways it can rot silently:
//
//  1. the recipe still expands to the exact 774 contact edges the winning run
//     actuated, by hash -- a knob edit that changes the schedule fails here
//     rather than on the phone;
//  2. the recipe stays a delta on the shipped KNOBS0, and the shipped default
//     is not dragged along with it (the default is what the 3000-seed story
//     gate measures; the recipe is what the device ran);
//  3. every control the recipe names is one the resolved profile can actuate,
//     and the two hall-flash points stay distinct -- the winning run pressed
//     `light` and `hall` at different measured coordinates, and collapsing them
//     onto one control would silently actuate a different schedule.
