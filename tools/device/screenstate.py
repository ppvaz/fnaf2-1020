"""Classify an adb screencap: prints night, gameover, or other.

Correction 2026-08-26: the night predicate had a false positive. The "HELP
WANTED" newspaper -- the cutscene FNaF 2 plays when a New Game starts -- read as
`night`, because it is bright everywhere and the flashlight-meter box therefore
clears the > 90 test (measured 154.6 against the office's 165.6). The original
reasoning was sound for every screen it had been shown: a lit meter means the
office. It had simply never been shown a screen that is bright all over, because
no route had ever pressed New Game. plans/13 needs that route for the fresh-save
ladder, so the gap became reachable.

The fix is a global-brightness guard, and it is the safe direction: it can only
take `night` away, never grant it. Measured over every office frame available --
plain, hall lit, vent lit, and under the first-run tutorial overlay -- rows 500
and 700 mean 14.5-35.1, against the newspaper's 112.5. The threshold sits at 80,
roughly a factor of two from either side. The same two scanlines are added to the
--adb-fast path so both paths answer alike; without them the fast path cannot see
global brightness at all.

night = the office HUD is on screen: flashlight meter lit top-left, or the
pink mask bar bottom-left (still visible in the masked view). Title, game
over, jumpscare and static otherwise read "other". `gameover` additionally
requires both the red face and bright lower-center text, avoiding false
positives on a jumpscare or title screen. 2400x1080 landscape.

Default mode reads a PNG from stdin. `--adb-fast [timeout]` captures a raw
frame on-device and transfers only ten scanlines used by the night predicate.
That avoids moving a multi-megabyte PNG over USB for every safety-watch poll.
