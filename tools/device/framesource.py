"""One frame source for every video instrument: ffmpeg today, a shared decode
when one is offered.

WHY IT EXISTS

grade-run.sh decodes the same recording nine times: camtrace, sweepcheck
(twice: rgb and gray), keyframes (twice), windpct, grade-minus7, run-timeline
and grade-night each spawn their own ffmpeg with their own ``fps=``/``scale=``
/``crop=`` chain and read rawvideo from its stdout. Measured on
night5-final2's 232 s recording, one core, niced: a single decode is 55-72 s,
and the video part of the pipeline is ~600 of 703 s. Nine decodes of one file
is where the iteration time goes.

The fix that keeps every instrument's bytes identical is to decode ONCE and
fan the branches out: one ffmpeg with ``-filter_complex "[0:v]split=N..."``
where each branch carries exactly the chain its instrument uses today, each
branch written to a named pipe, and the instruments reading their pipes
concurrently. ffmpeg blocks on the slowest reader, so memory stays at
pipe-buffer size and wall time becomes max(decode, slowest consumer) instead
of the sum. Nothing decoded is written to a file: the 60 fps full-resolution
branch is 2.2 MB per frame (93 GB for a 700 s night), and /tmp on this host is
tmpfs.

This module is the seam. ``frames(path, chain, pix_fmt, frame_size)`` yields
frames exactly as the instruments read them from ffmpeg's stdout. When the
environment carries ``FNAF2_FRAME_SOURCE_DIR``, and that directory holds a
pipe registered for the same ``(path, chain, pix_fmt)`` (see ``spec_name``),
the frames come from the pipe instead; otherwise ffmpeg is spawned as before.
An instrument therefore cannot get different bytes from the two paths unless
the chain differs -- and the chain is the key.

``plan_split(...)`` builds the single ffmpeg command for a set of specs; the
orchestration (mkfifo, launch ffmpeg, launch consumers, reap) lives in the
pipeline, not here.
