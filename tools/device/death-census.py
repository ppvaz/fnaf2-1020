"""What killed us, across every night we have on disk.

grade-run.sh answers "what happened in THIS run". Nothing answered "what keeps
happening", and that turned out to be the question worth asking: pulling the
death frame out of all 33 recordings and tiling them put the answer on one
screen in a way no per-run report had.

    Withered Foxy   19
    Puppet           3
    Golden Freddy    2
    no jumpscare     9   (aborted on cams, or masked at the end)

BUT READ THE TIMES, NOT JUST THE FACES. The obvious reading of "Foxy killed 79%
of them" is the documented BB->Foxy chain -- BB reaches the office, g96 takes
every light, the hall cannot be flashed, Foxy's D runs out. That reading is
wrong here, and the alive column is what refutes it: those deaths cluster at
about 30 s, and ON-DEVICE-VALIDATION.md puts Balloon Boy's earliest possible
arrival at the left OPENING at 25 s, with at least another five-second roll
needed to get inside. He cannot have taken the lights yet. Foxy is killing on
his own, early, because the hall flash never reached him -- which is what a
monitor desync does: with the cams up, the hall press lands on the camera map.
The device owner saw exactly that before any log did ("haven't seen any hall
light", "started panning view instead of flashing").

The one death where the chain IS the story is night 34, the longest run at
120 s: Foxy's face and Balloon Boy's balloon in the same frame.

So this exists to keep the distinction visible. A census of faces alone would
have shipped the wrong cause; the faces and the clock together give the right
one.

# The number that matters is not the face, it is the clock.

# ON-DEVICE-VALIDATION.md measured what an unflashed Foxy costs, before any of
# this pilot existed: "Three closed-loop 6th Night mask-camp trials died at
# 29/31/31 s to the W. Foxy office lunge ... the mask does not deter him, his D
# grows unflashed." So ~30 s is not a coincidence and not a distribution -- it
# is the constant for "Foxy was never flashed".
#
# It also rules out the reading the faces invite. The BB->Foxy chain needs BB in
# the office taking the lights, and he cannot reach the left opening before 25 s
# with at least another roll to get inside. A 30 s death is Foxy killing on his
# own, from the very start, because the hall flash never reached him.
