"""Regression for the sensor declaration. Synthetic frames, no phone.

plans/15. A classifier calibrated on one capture method must refuse frames from
another rather than resize them into a plausible answer. The repository already
paid for the general version of this: the cue helper's threshold was derived
from `screencap` frames and an offline bilinear simulation rather than from
Android's own VirtualDisplay scaler, and is therefore still uncalibrated -- so
the 42 ms sensor cannot answer the question the 225 ms sensor can.
