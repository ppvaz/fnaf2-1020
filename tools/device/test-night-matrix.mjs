// The per-story-night matrix: every night the campaign can request must
// build, replay, and receive a configuration-correct model-gate verdict.
// No phone required.
//
// Why this file exists (plans/13, work package 1). `build()` used to end its
// template extraction with `throw new Error('no attack cycle in the sampled
// night')`, and Nights 1 and 3 both hit it. That single message covered two
// opposite facts:
//
//   Night 1  the sourced AI table never arms Balloon Boy (peak AI 0), so a
//            night with no attack cycle is CORRECT and the branch is carried
//            only as a fail-safe for an unexpected classifier read;
//   Night 3  the table arms him at AI 1 then 2, so he is rare, not absent --
//            the prior route's seed 7 did not roll him, and answering that by
//            dropping the branch would have shipped a plan with no BB handling
//            for a night that can produce one. The repaired route now samples
//            him at seed 7; the source-based invariant remains the same.
//
// Only the source table separates those, so `resolveAttack()` asks it. This
// gate holds the resulting matrix, and it holds the fail-closed direction too:
// a sample that shows an attack on a night whose table cannot produce one is
// an observation/config mismatch, and the builder must refuse it rather than
// quietly pick a night to believe.
//
// The device runs nothing this suite has not priced, so a night that fails
// here is a night the campaign runner may not request.
