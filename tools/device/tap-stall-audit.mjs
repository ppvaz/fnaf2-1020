// Audit every scheduled contact of a device run against the Cue Helper's
// native frame trace: was the button there when the contact arrived, did the
// effect follow, and did a frame stall longer than the contact cover it.
//
// WHY IT EXISTS
//
// night5-strokes3 (2026-09-12) recorded two CORRECTED cycle gates and the
// standing reading was "a lost MASK press, about one cycle in eight, a
// Bernoulli rate no estimator fixes". The retained frame trace said otherwise
// once it was read against the schedule: in both cycles a 33 ms MONITOR tap
// (the camdrop's at +14000 in one cycle, the raise at +10100 in the other)
// fell inside a capture-frame interval longer than 33 ms and never registered,
// so the mask tap at +14449 hit the raised monitor bar and lowered it instead.
// Every mask tap sent with the button present landed.
//
// Whether a stall COVERED those two taps depends on the clock at the tens-of-
// milliseconds level, and the gate reads only bracket that clock to 180 ms;
// the tool therefore reports it as ambiguous there. What holds at both ends of
// the bracket: both lost contacts were 33 ms monitor taps, and the mask taps
// that followed arrived with the monitor up. The dump
// makes the mechanism legible: the monitor flip is level-triggered with a
// one-shot latch (g257 raises on `Multiple Touch` over `white button` and
// sets `flip panel button` value 1; g258 clears it when no touch is on `drop
// button`; g614 lowers via `MouseOnObject`), so a contact that fits between
// two event-loop ticks is invisible and a longer hold flips exactly once.
//
// The root is a floor equal to its own poll: `MIN_CONTACT_MS` and
// `FUSION_POLL_MS` are both 33 in recipe.mjs, which is mistake-register #7
// one level down -- a contact of exactly one poll period has zero slack.
//
// WHAT IT IS NOT
//
// actuation-frame-metric.py reads the trace alone (state coverage, no
// schedule). input-frame-align.py aligns a Perfetto input trace to frames, and
// this handset advertises no `android.input.inputevent` source, so that tool
// cannot run here. This one aligns the SCHEDULE -- the compiled blocks in the
// run's own request.json, on the executor's wall clock -- to the frames,
// through a clock BRACKET derived from the gate samples (see clockBracket). It measures nothing about dispatch; a contact it calls MISSING was
// scheduled and had no visible effect, which is all the trace can say.
//
// The intervals are those of the helper's capture stream, not the game loop.
// The inference that a covered contact was swallowed rests on the coincidence
// above; SurfaceFlinger latency (grade-run's SF_LAYER step) would confirm it
// from the game's side.
//
// Exit 3 when a contact is MISSING or arrived with its button absent: that is
// information about the run, not an instrument failure, and grade-run.sh's
// step() reads it that way.
