// Every committed winner must still compile into a bundle the campaign accepts.
//
// Winners are committed (CLAUDE.md) so that a night can be re-run from a clean
// checkout on any machine: on 2026-09-15 the k3 Night 7 bundle could not be
// rebuilt from the evidence records' knob deltas, and a run pack's
// winnerCommitted check means nothing unless the committed file still builds.
// So this compiles each tools/device/*-winner.json of schema winner-v1 exactly
// as `npm run device:emit` does, then runs it through the acceptance
// `cli.js campaign --bundle` applies before it opens a phone: the campaign
// spec for the bundle's nights and profile, and one compiled plan per night.
// It is the chain night-run.sh drives, minus the device.
//
// A winner whose replay no longer matches its gate fails here, and that is the
// point: the engine changed under a measured plan, and the decision to
// re-measure it or retire it belongs in the diff that changed the engine.
