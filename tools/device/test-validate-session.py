"""Synthetic contract for the v1 session manifest/event validator.

The point of this gate is not that a good session passes. It is that each way
of being wrong fails for its *own* stated reason: a validator that rejects
everything with one generic error is indistinguishable from one that rejects
everything, and would let the next malformed session be explained away.
