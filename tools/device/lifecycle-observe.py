"""Name the lifecycle screen, or refuse. Adds classes; never overrides the authority.

`screenstate.py` classifies night / gameover / other, and stays the authority on
whether a night is running -- CLAUDE.md is explicit that a detector which knows
one way to be dead must never be what says you are alive. That rule cost this
project two runs reported at 163 s and 153 s which were 26.0 s and 72.2 s alive.

What it does not do is distinguish everything else. `other` covers the title, the
New Game confirmation, the Options screen, the "HELP WANTED" newspaper, a death,
a minigame, static, and a screen nobody has seen. plans/13 package 3 needs those
apart, because "the office HUD disappeared" is not a clear and an aborted
recording must not grade as a campaign advance.

So this runs screenstate first and only refines its `other`.

    screencap -p | lifecycle-observe.py          # state=title
    lifecycle-observe.py --adb --verbose

Output is one line: `state=<name>` (exit 0) or `unknown=<reason>` (exit 3).

Ordering matters and is measured, not assumed: the logo box reads 0.206 on an
OFFICE frame, higher than its 0.050 threshold, so a title test placed before the
HUD test would claim the office is a title screen. The HUD bars (0.151 in the
office, 0.000 on every title screen) are consulted first.

Not yet modelled, and deliberately reported as unknown rather than guessed:
the 6 AM transition and the minigames. Neither has been captured -- 6 AM needs a
survived night. `state=unknown` is the correct answer for them today.

One correction worth carrying: the death static on this build is DARK (frame
mean 34.1, the same as the office), not the bright static the cue helper's death
signature was measured against. Brightness does not separate it; roughness does.

# --- the two dark screens: 6 AM and the story-night intro card ------------
#
# Measured in FRACTIONS of the frame and consulted BEFORE load_frame's sensor
# gate, because they are sensor-independent by construction -- the same
# argument nightpredicate.py makes for the alive/dead rule. The only fixtures
# that exist are 1280x576 `screenrecord` frames, which the calibrated
# `screencap` model correctly refuses; teaching one fact twice, once per
# sensor, is what plans/15 exists to stop.
#
# Calibrated 2026-08-26 on the first cleared Night 1 (`n1-full-1640`) -- also
# the first 6 AM this project has ever recorded. Measured, with controls:
#
#   class          frame mean     confetti%      clock columns
#   6 AM (win)     1.80-2.41      0.059-0.326    0.153-0.203
#   intro card     0.06-1.29      0.000 exactly  0.000-0.205
#   death frames   29.7-39.4      0.000-5.134    0.027-0.075
#   death static   34.6           0.000          0.593
#   game over      19.1           4.930          0.132
#   office/night   22.2-59.4      0.000-1.140    0.027-0.332

#
# `mean < 5` isolates the two dark screens from every other class by a wide
# margin -- the nearest other class is 19.1. Within the dark pair, the win
# confetti is not merely *small* on the intro card, it is **exactly zero**
# across sixteen frames from two separate recordings, while the lowest 6 AM
# frame reads 0.059. That is why the threshold sits at 0.02 and not halfway.
#
# NOT separated here, and reported rather than guessed: WHICH night an intro
# card names. Reading "1st" from "2nd" is a different problem with different
# evidence, and plans/13's identity contract needs that second fact -- so a
# detected card must never stand in for a verified night.
