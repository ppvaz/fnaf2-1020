"""How long was the run actually ALIVE, and what ended it?

This exists because a run length was reported that the run did not achieve.
Night 6-37 was published at 153 s and night 6-36 at 163 s -- a new record -- and the
retained classifier frames showed what those seconds contained: a monitor flip,
then a "12:00 AM 6th Night" restart screen, then static, then the "Take cake to
the children" death minigame. The game had died around 70 s and the pilot kept
pressing into it, because the watchdog's fast path recognised exactly one way of
being dead (the static screen) and answered "night" to everything else.

Wall time between "night started" and "the driver stopped" is not survival. It
is only survival if something checked the game was still running throughout, and
nothing did. So this reads the recording and reports the interval the HUD was
actually present, using the same predicate screenstate.py uses live:

    the flashlight meter, or the mask bar at the bottom of the office.

Neither is drawn on the death static, the death minigames, the night-start card
or the title menu, which is precisely why those screens are what a dead run
looks like to it.

Usage: grade-night.py VIDEO [--fps 4] [--require-seconds 420]

Exit status is non-zero when the run did not reach --require-seconds, so this
can gate a claim rather than merely describe one.
