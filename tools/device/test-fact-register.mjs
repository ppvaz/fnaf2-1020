//
// This is the gate for the class of miss that cost 2026-09-11 a night and a
// hypothesis. `intersection-state-gate.mjs` consumes the helper's native button
// downstroke scores for maskOn and says "a missing stroke score is a refusal,
// never a luma fallback". The executor answers the same question from the 20x9
// grid and falls back to exactly that luma refutation -- and every CORRECTED
// gate in the 2026-09-12T02-20 run decided on a frame whose screen the
// classifier could not even identify. Both files had been in the tree for
// weeks. Nothing compared them, because nothing was looking at FACTS.
//
// The rule is narrow on purpose. It fires only where the weakness can actuate:
// a producer under `apps/device/src`, the lane that presses buttons, using
// evidence ranked below the best the tree offers for that fact. Facts whose
// authority the charter fixes -- screen identity and the night origin, where
// the Python classifier is authoritative BECAUSE a detector that knows one way
// to be dead must not be what says you are alive -- are reported and never
// ranked.
