// classifier could not even identify. Both files had been in the tree for
// weeks. Nothing compared them, because nothing was looking at FACTS.
//
// The rule is narrow on purpose. It fires only where the weakness can actuate:
// a producer under `apps/device/src`, the lane that presses buttons, using
// evidence ranked below the best the tree offers for that fact. Facts whose
// authority the charter fixes -- screen identity and the night origin, where
// the Python classifier is authoritative BECAUSE a detector that knows one way
// to be dead must not be what says you are alive -- are reported and never
// ranked.
