// An anchor aim must put the EFFECTIVE epoch inside a confirmed winning band.
//
// An aim is not an epoch. The executor releases the schedule at
// `latched onset + aimMs + k*periodMs`, the latched onset leads the frame-trace
// onset, and the game then acts an input latency later, so
//
//   effective = aimMs + k*periodMs + onsetBiasMs + inputLatency
//
// and only `effective` can be compared against the epochs a census scored.
// Nothing checked that. On 2026-09-20, reconstructing a lost Night 6 aim, I
// derived one from the band alone -- omitting the -70 ms onset bias entirely
// and using the monitor-up press-to-effect figure (200-285 ms) in place of the
// binding's own hall-lit input latency (47 ms, 1-82). Both errors are invisible
// to every existing gate: the aim is a number in a register and the band is a
// number in an evidence file, and no check multiplies them out.
//
// `night6-anchor-aim-h-20260913.json` has all three terms and is the worked
// example: 4870 - 70 + [47, 82] = [4847, 4882], inside [4766.67, 4916.67] with
// 80 ms to the low edge and 34 ms to the high one.
//
// This reads each ANCHOR_AIMS entry's own evidence record. An entry whose
// evidence carries the terms must land; one that does not is reported, because
// an aim nobody can re-derive is the shape the untracked-winner debt already
// has too much of.
