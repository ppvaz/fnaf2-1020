# The one title/menu selector. Source this; do not re-derive it.

# plans/13 keeps four facts apart, and the runners used to collapse all four
# into a single environment variable named `NIGHT`:
#
#   GameConfig  which night is being played              (6, or custom dials)
#   MenuTarget  which title item gets pressed            (newGame|continue|sixthNight|customNight)
#   SaveState   what the save cursor actually holds      (only an observation can say)
#   Policy      which gated plan is executing            (recipe.mjs + human-gate.mjs)
#
# `NIGHT=continue` was all four at once: a menu action standing in for a night
# identity, resolved by `NIGHT_TAP=$TAP_CONTINUE; [ "$NIGHT" = 6th ] &&
# NIGHT_TAP=$TAP_6TH` in four separate scripts, none of which ever looked at the
# screen. `Continue` does not say which night the save cursor owns, and after
# the target device's save was lost it does not say the item is even there.
#
# So: every press goes through menu_select, every menu_select needs a positive
# observation of the item it is about to press, and New Game -- which is
# save-destructive and has never been pressed by any route -- additionally needs
# a deliberate capability the caller must set for that one run.
#
# Requires coords.sh to have been sourced (for the measured tap coordinates).
