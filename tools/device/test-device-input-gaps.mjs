// The plan must respect the gaps the PHONE needs to accept an input.
//
// This gate exists because the same failure cost two days twice. The simulator
// emits a schedule in frames; it has no concept of an input being *refused*,
// so a plan can be 1000/1000 in the engine and still be un-runnable on the
// device. Every constraint below is a measurement recorded in
// docs/device/ON-DEVICE-VALIDATION.md, not a guess, and each one is quoted at
// its check so a future edit has to argue with the measurement rather than
// with a number.
//
// The failure this was written for: the pilot raises the monitor and selects a
// camera 134 ms later. The port swallows that selection and leaves the feed on
// CAM 11. The pilot then winds on a camera that is not CAM 11, sweeps cameras
// that never got selected, and reads a vent that is not on screen -- and
// because nothing observes the result, it never recovers. Rendered classifier
// frames from nights 6-22 to 6-25 show exactly that: CAM 11 with the music box gauge,
// captured at a moment the schedule believed was the office.

// The sourced constant, not the swipe-era one.
//
// src/config.js: MONITOR_ANIM_UP = 12 frames = 204 ms, decompiled and gated by
// sourcetest. engine.js:238 drops a camera select outright unless the monitor
// has finished raising:
//
//     if (this.monitor === MON_UP && C.CAMS[n]) this.cam = n;
//
// so a select delivered during MON_RAISING sets nothing and the feed stays
// where it was. That is the game's own rule, and it is measured press-to-press
// because setMonitor starts the animation on the press.
//
// ON-DEVICE-VALIDATION.md also records 500 ms ("swallowed by the flip and left
// the feed on CAM 11"), but read the bullet it sits in: it is the `input
// swipe` era, whose helper cost ~170 ms and whose schedule was quantised into
// 190 ms slots. That 500 is a slot-quantised gap measured through an actuator
// this runner no longer uses, and pricing the HID route against it would
// repeat the mistake of pricing against the ideal 267 ms sweep, pointed the
// other way. It is kept here as context, not as the threshold.
// Derived, never restated. This gate and the emitter it checks must not each
// hold their own copy of the animation length: a 204 here against a 200 there
// is how the emitter relaxed a raise to exactly the gap this file then called a
// violation, which is precisely the two-files-one-number failure that produced
// the 90-vs-100 contact floor. MONITOR_ANIM_UP_MS comes from recipe.mjs, which
// converts src/config.js's sourced frame count with the same 60 fps the rest of
// the codebase uses. The 33 ms margin absorbs the rounding (config's comment
// calls 12 frames 0.204 s).
