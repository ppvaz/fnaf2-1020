"""Did the sweep actually *flash* each camera, not merely select it?

camtrace.py reads the lime highlight on the camera map ("which camera is
selected"). A Minus 7 sweep exists to apply the camera-light stun, which needs
the light on *while* that camera is the selected feed.

WHY THIS IS NOT A BRIGHTNESS MEASURE ANYMORE (2026-08-27). The old mean-feed
version could not resolve the c33 LIGHT_AFTER geometry (each camera lit for
2-4 frames on a tearing transition): on the NO_LIGHT control it read cam07 lit
every sweep, on ALT_LIGHT it was coin-flip, and on the *cleared* n1-grey-2202
it was 5/73.

The NO_LIGHT / ALT_LIGHT controls are the fix. ALT_LIGHT lights EVEN sweeps
and leaves ODD ones select-only under one night's feed content -- a clean A/B.
`--recalibrate ALT.mp4` fits, per camera, a rule over three window features of
the feed CENTRE (300,150)-(980,340) -- the tear bands are horizontal and live
at the ROI edges:

  bf   max over the window of the mid-grey fraction (45..200)         -- the
       flashlight adds lit room content
  pve  the window's PEAK vertical-edge density minus its median       -- the
       flashlight reveals room edges a black feed does not have; the median
       subtraction removes the feed's own baseline structure
  rv   row-to-row variance of the window's brightest frame            -- real
       illumination is spatially uniform (low rv); a "bright" dark frame is
       bright because of tear BANDS (high rv)

  a camera is lit iff  bf >= A  and  (pve >= B  or  rv <= C)

and a SWEEP is lit iff at least two of the three cameras are -- the one weak
camera (usually CAM 10, the brightest room, least contrast from the light)
cannot flip the verdict. On the c33 controls: NO_LIGHT 25/25 sweeps correctly
dark, ALT_LIGHT 25/25, all-lit 23/25 (the 2 misses call a lit sweep dark --
the safe direction).

CAVEATS -- read before trusting a number.

1. EVERY calibration frame is an EMPTY ROOM. The c33-dark/alt/stable runs are
   early Night 2 on Continue, before the animatronics leave the stage. A real
   Minus 7 night has Toy Bonnie on CAM 04, Toy Chica returning to CAM 07,
   Withereds moving through -- and an animatronic in the feed CHANGES every
   feature this classifier reads: a dark figure lowers `bf`, adds or destroys
   edges (`pve`), and breaks the spatial uniformity (`rv`). The thresholds
   here may be overfit to empty rooms and quietly fail when the room is
   occupied -- which is exactly the case the sweep exists to handle. This is
   unmeasured. Do not treat a clean sweepcheck pass on an occupied-room night
   as validation until the classifier has been re-checked against labelled
   frames with animatronics present (the same control gap CLAUDE.md records
   for `grey=` and the yellow anchor).

2. CAM 07 (Main Hall) does not transfer across nights. Its lit and dark feeds
   overlap on brightness (both ~178 mean, n=275); the only separator is the
   edge spike / uniformity, and Main Hall's tearing edge-density varies night
   to night, so a threshold fit on one recording false-positives on another
   (7/25 on c33-dark with the c33-alt threshold). CAM 07 is only reliable
   when SELF-calibrated from the same night's own dark sweeps -- i.e. on an
   ALT_LIGHT run. CAM 10 / CAM 04 use the (mean, bf) sweet-spot frame count,
   which is more absolute and did hold across the c33 runs.

3. The sweep verdict is a >=2/3 vote precisely because of (2): a real all-lit
   night cannot self-calibrate CAM 07, so the two reliable cameras carry it.
   A sweep where CAM 10 and CAM 04 both flash almost certainly flashed CAM 07
   too -- same light contact, same geometry.
