# Stop a target game without destroying the evidence the run just created.
#
# On 2026-09-20 an ad-hoc capture loop force-stopped FNaF 3 *during* the
# post-night minigame -- the sequence that plays after a night completes.
# FNaF 3 happens to bank the night before that sequence, so the run survived by
# luck and its own provenance records the near miss
# (docs/evidence/fnaf3-first-night-20260920.json). Had the game banked after it
# instead, the teardown would have erased the result the run existed to create.
#
# The rule this encodes: after a night, a game is stopped only once the title
# screen has been READ. Nothing here waits a tuned interval and hopes, because
# the title read is not a proxy for the save -- it is the save. FNaF 3's Night 1
# was graded by exactly this observation ("the title afterwards reads LOAD GAME
# 2"), so a confident title read means the bank already happened and is already
# durable. That is why there is no settle constant in this file: a number
# invented here would be a floor anchored to the route it protects, which is
# mistake register entry 7.
#
# The deadline is a bound, not a measurement. The post-night sequence's length
# is UNKNOWN(not-measured) for every game here, so exceeding the deadline is
# never read as "it must be done by now". It fails the other way: the game is
# LEFT RUNNING and the caller is told, because a phone sitting on a minigame is
# recoverable by an operator and a force-stop through a save write is not.
#
