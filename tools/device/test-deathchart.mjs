// Mock regression for the death-cause chart. No phone, no gate run.
//
// The claim worth pinning is not the picture, it is that the picture cannot
// quietly drop a death. Three ways it could:
//
//   1. The engine grows a seventh `kill()` reason and the chart has no slice
//      for it. A chart that silently omits a cause is worse than no chart --
//      it reads as coverage, the same failure GRADE_RUN=1 produced when it
//      graded a file that did not exist.
//   2. Slices get ordered by count, so Foxy is blue on one night and orange
//      on the next and two panels cannot be compared.
//   3. A long label runs into the count column, which is what the first
//      render did ("...at a 5s check)99").
