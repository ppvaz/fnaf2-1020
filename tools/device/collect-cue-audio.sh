# **Device action.** It cold-starts FNaF, presses 6th Night, mutes the opening
# call, and waits while Balloon Boy takes his route. It sends no other input:
# surviving is not the point, and a run that dies still contains the vocals.
#
# Plan 08 package 1 needs labeled positive windows. Each round is one fresh
# route from CAM 10, so the vocals arrive in a known early stretch and the rest
# of the round is negative background. Rounds are recorded as session
# boundaries in a sidecar TSV, because package 2's holdout must split by
# session and never by adjacent windows from one recording.
#
# The helper must already be capturing with FNaF focused; audio is pulled from
# it, and raw game audio stays in ignored captures/.
