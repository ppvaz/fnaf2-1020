# Gate for the session producer. Mock adb, synthetic artifacts, no phone.
#
# This drives the real shell entry points the runners call -- fnaf_session_begin,
# probe_target, record, event, artifact, finalize -- so everything except the
# adb round trips is the shipped code path.
#
# What it is actually asserting, and why each one has a control:
#
#   * a session validates end to end, AND the same session with one fact
#     removed fails. A validator that accepts everything and a producer that
#     emits nothing look identical from a single passing run.
#   * the cross-clock event passes *because* the alignment edge exists: the
#     control disables the device-clock probe and the same event is refused
#     with clock-alignment-missing.
#   * an artifact's sha256 is the file's sha256, checked against an independent
#     digest rather than against itself.
#   * a file that was never written becomes a fault event, never an entry. A
#     manifest that names a file nobody wrote is the failure grade-run.sh
#     exists for.
#   * finalize keeps the spool when the manifest does not validate. A silently
#     discarded spool would leave no evidence that a session was attempted.
