// The plan compiler must refuse a press scheduled inside an animation the
// engine drops it during. No phone required.
//
// Both rules were written after live nights were lost to them on 2026-09-08.
// The monitor rule is the one that matters most here: a wind press moved to
// 100 ms after the raise tap looked fine in the simulator, because
// `press('wind')` latches `winding = true` and `isWinding` simply waits for
// MON_UP. On the phone the monitor was still animating, the wind button was
// not on screen, the contact hit the office underneath, and the cycle wound
// nothing. The simulator latches presses; the device needs the control to
// exist at contact time, and only the compiler can see the difference.
