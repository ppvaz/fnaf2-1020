// Refuse a plan that only just clears a device timing floor, and refuse a floor
// that was calibrated to the route instead of to its own measurement.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS. `artifact-commands.mjs` already refuses a mask press that
// lands inside the monitor-down animation. It never fired for the Night 5
// route, because that route presses the mask at +400 ms and the floor is
// MONITOR_MASK_READY_MS = 400: `400 < 400` is false, so the plan compiled in
// silence. The floor's own comment says it was set to "the +400 ms timing used
// by the Night 5 route", and test-artifact-animation-gates.mjs then pinned
// that boundary as correct -- so the one check that could have caught this was
// calibrated to accept it, and a test protected the calibration.
//
// On the phone that zero cost about one cycle in eight: the mask press was
// graded MISSING with the monitor observably down, and every corrected cycle
// handed a vent occupant a free pass (docs/evidence/night5-mask-tick-budget-*).
//
// A floor with no margin is a floor that documents the status quo. Two things
// are checked here, and both are about margin rather than legality:
//
//   1. every compiled plan clears every timing floor by at least the jitter
//      allowance, not by zero;
//   2. every floor that derives from a measurement stands at least the jitter
//      allowance above that measurement.

// The allowance is TWO Fusion polls, not one, and that is the whole point.
//
// 33 ms is already MIN_CONTACT_MS, FUSION_POLL_MS and RAISE_MARGIN_MS. When the
// allowance was also 33, "this plan clears its floor by the allowance" meant
// "this plan clears its floor by exactly one poll" -- so a single dropped poll,
// the smallest error the device can make, puts the contact ON the boundary, and
// the check passed it because it only refused values BELOW 33. A margin equal
// to the quantum of the error it protects against is not a margin.
//
// What that cost, measured 2026-09-19: every shipped minus-toys plan put its
// once-per-cycle mask press at monitor-down + 449 ms against a 416 ms floor --
// slack exactly 33 -- roughly 42 times a night. The floor is anchored to a
// native trace (mask button absent through 322 ms, faint at ~337 ms, fully
// visible at ~382.5 ms), so that press lands 33 ms after the button finishes
// appearing. Three Night 3 device runs died across two strategies, at least two
// to Balloon Boy, who no strategy's stall holds on any night and whom only the
// mask cadence answers. A lost mask press is a cycle BB walks through.
//
// This is mistake-register item 7 one level up: item 7 was a FLOOR calibrated to
// the route it protected; this is the ALLOWANCE calibrated to the error it
// protects against. Both look derived and neither can refuse anything.
// ONE Fusion poll, not two.
//
// Two was tried on 2026-09-19 and reverted, and the reason is worth keeping:
// raising it forced every shipped plan's knobs to move, `validateWinner`
// normalises a winner by filling in KNOBS0 defaults, so changing the DEFAULTS
// re-hashes every winner that inherits any of them -- which silently broke the
// anchor bindings those hashes key (`no anchor aim registered for binding ...`)
// and the replayHash bindings that pin a winner's emitted plan. A margin change
// is never local: it re-binds the proven routes.
//
// What survived from that attempt is the floor correction below, which was the
// real defect. The floors used to embed a margin of their own, so this gate's
// allowance stacked on top: a plan standing 66.5 ms above the measured
// mask-button visibility was reported as clearing by 33, and chasing that
// phantom 33 took the 10/20 measured band from 120/120 to 0/120. With floors
// now equal to their measurement, a reported slack IS the true margin, and the
// shipped mask press reads 66 ms rather than a misleading 33.
