// Per-instruction timing margin map for the Minus Toys device loop.
//
// The deterministic gate (minus-toys-plan.mjs --gate) says 200/200 for a
// schedule that has almost no slack: the published strategy's own write-up
// (docs/strategy/MINUS-3-STRATEGY.md sec.3) states its error budget is only
// ~0.66 s per cycle, and the first device run (n2-minustoys-0117, 2026-08-28)
// died to a BB walk-in -> Foxy chain that the gate could not see.
//
// This maps where that slack actually is. It replays the loop with ONE
// instruction shifted in isolation (no other jitter) and reports the widest
// early/late offset at which every seed of a fixed set still survives -- i.e.
// how far off that one press can be before the night stops being winnable.
// It also reports the whole-schedule phase margin: the epoch/T0 alignment
// error the device can absorb before the same thing happens.
//
//   node tools/device/minus-toys-margin.mjs [--night=N] [--seeds=N] [--max=MS]
//
// `--steps` in cyclesearch.mjs asks the same question for Minus 7; this is its
// Minus Toys counterpart. It is a measurement of the MODEL (no randomness), and
// it inherits the engine's Golden-Freddy-interval and Toy-cam-stall gaps
// (plans/02 sec.5) -- read it as "the model has at most this much slack here".

// every press together. The modern executor does not do that in `blocking`
// arm mode. It parks the opening prefix -- everything before the first wind --
// runs it on the night's own clock, then blocks on the CAM 09 + CAM 11 arm
// observation and releases the REMAINDER when the pair confirms. Whatever wall
// time that observation costs past the plan's own cursor is added to every
// press from the first wind onward and to nothing before it (`phaseLagMs` in
// apps/device/src/adb-device-local-executor.js).
//
// **This response is BANDED, not a cliff, and `edge()` above must not be used
// on it.** `edge()` scans outward and stops at the first failure, which is
// correct only for a contiguous basin. The model's response to phase repeats
// on the game's 1-second grid with several separate loss bands inside it, so a
// stop-at-first-failure scan reports the first band edge and silently hides
// every winning window beyond it. Read on 2026-09-11 that way, the first edge
// (408 ms) was mistaken for the whole budget -- which would have condemned a
// 1320 ms run that the model actually scores 3000/3000.
//
// `phase-reconstruct.mjs` is the authority here: it already computes the loss
// bands and reports a measured run's delivered offset against them. This
// section exists so the margin map does not imply a single number.
