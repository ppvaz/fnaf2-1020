// Pin the FNaF 1 simulator and its two policies.
//
// The headline result is a census, and a census is only worth the controls
// around it. The checks below are in three groups:
//
//   1. **Controls that must fail, and must fail for the stated reason.**
//      `sealed` must die of power on every seed and never to a character;
//      parking the camera anywhere but CAM 4B must let Freddy in on every
//      seed. A suite where nothing dies cannot tell a working defence from a
//      dead code path -- mistake register #12.
//   2. **The census itself**, at a reduced seed count so it runs in CI. The
//      3000-seed figures are reported in the docs; this pins that the model
//      and policies still clear a representative slice.
//   3. **Mechanics that the census result depends on**, each anchored to the
//      group that states it, so a regression names the rule it broke.
