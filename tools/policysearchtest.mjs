// Plan 21 package 4: reproducible constrained positive/negative campaign.
//
// This campaign's candidates are the Night 1 Minimal family and two deliberate
// mutations of it. They are declared controls, so it runs the duplicate control
// in `record` mode: every candidate still carries its closed-family
// classification, but a known control is not rejected for being one. An
// invention campaign uses the default `reject` mode instead.
