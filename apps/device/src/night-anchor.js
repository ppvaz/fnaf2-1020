/**
 * Place the night schedule's release against the game's own one-second grid.
 *
 * Two independent facts meet here:
 *   - WHEN the night began: the Cue Helper's latched onset (NightOnsetLatch.java,
 *     rule in @fnaf2-1020/adapters/night-onset), read over a forwarded socket
 *     together with a device->host clock offset bounded by RTT/2;
 *   - WHETHER actuation may start: the lifecycle classifier's `state=night`,
 *     which stays the only authorization. Nothing is released before it.
 *
 * The plan is made from the latch, not from the authorization. The classifier
 * takes 1.8-1.9 s to answer (night5-anchor1/2), so a plan that waited for it
 * landed 2.18-2.22 s after the onset and could not reach k<=2. Instead the
 * release instants onset + aim + k s, for k = 0..maxK, are computed as soon as
 * the latch is read, and each one fires only if the authorization has already
 * arrived by then; otherwise the next k is tried.
 *
 * `maxK` bounds how many whole game seconds past the onset the release may
 * land. The epoch response is periodic only so far: for binding fnv1a-81b5e51c
 * epochs 233/1233/2233 score 3000/3000 but 3233 scores 2673/3000 (Balloon Boy).
 *
 * Never blocks a night: every refusal releases as soon as the night is
 * authorized, exactly as before anchoring existed, and names why in an
 * `origin.anchor` event. What the events do NOT claim: the delivered epoch
 * (released - onset, mod 1000) minus the aim is the clock estimate's error
 * plus release jitter. Actuation latency (effect frame minus injection) is a
 * separate quantity and never enters it.
