# Plan progress

**Updated:** 2026-09-25.

**How to read this file.** It is a log, append-ordered from 2026-09-09: **the
newest work is at the bottom**, so read the last entry first. Everything before
that — the 2026-09-08 snapshot, the newest-first history back to 2026-08-20, the
standing directives of that period and the Minus 7 frontier notes — moved on
2026-09-24, unchanged, to [`archive/PROGRESS-2026-08-20-to-2026-09-08.md`](archive/PROGRESS-2026-08-20-to-2026-09-08.md).

Since that 09-08 snapshot: Night 5 reached 6 AM on 2026-09-12, Night 6 on
09-13, and Night 7 (10/20, `golden-freddy`) on 09-14, with a ten-run Night 7
cohort at 3 wins (k2, 09-14) and a predeclared one at 8 of 10 (k3, 09-18). The
current open work is model fidelity — see the last
entries and [`../docs/research/SOLVING-FNAF2.md`](../docs/research/SOLVING-FNAF2.md).

## Dashboard

| Plan | Closed / mandatory packages | Progress | Current state | Next gate |
|---|---:|---:|---|---|
| [01 — research pass](archive/01-research-pass.md) | 3 / 3 | **100%** | Done | None |
| [02 — Minus 3 mode](02-minus-3-mode.md) | 1 / 7 | **14%** | **Pkg 2a modelling done (`c038938`, 2026-08-28); device side open.** Engine has the `viewing`/`lastViewed`/marker split; `minustoystest.mjs` gates 200/200 + 100/100 worst + 0/200 no-split; `minus-toys-plan.mjs --night=N` emits a gated device plan (Night 1: 200/200). Glitchless Minus Two remains 16/200 — not a Minus Toys verdict. **Story campaign is a distinct, softer target (`MINUS-3-STRATEGY.md` §9):** CAM 09 nights 1–2, CAM 08 nights 3–5; Pedro hand-cleared 1/3/4 on the g56 uncaptured. | Measure the glitched Toy stun on hardware. Night 1 (`trial.sh DEVICE_POLICY=minus-toys CALIBRATION_STORY_NIGHT=1`, needs save reset to Night 1) is the clean calibration run — also the place to test the music-box audio phase clock against the −184 ms/min drift. |
| [03 — right-vent-camp mode](03-right-vent-camp-mode.md) | 1 / 5 | **20%** | Engine sourcing complete (2026-08-24). The existing 0/300 `rvctest` is a deliberately incomplete non-reactive skeleton, not the brayden/Shooter25 policy; decision table, coach, ladder and grading untouched. | Encode and measure the published four-way post-wind controller before designing lessons or quoting an Android rate. |
| [04 — optimize Minus 7](04-optimize-minus-7.md) | 3 / 4 | **75%** | Search and grading work complete | Replace inferred human profile with accumulated trainer traces |
| [05 — derive new strategy](05-derive-new-strategy.md) | 5 / 9 | **56%** | **Reopened 2026-08-28.** Original static-cover pass closed by sourced refutation; broader stateful/event-driven invention campaign is active on the now-sourced model/search substrate. | Package 6: define and source the novel-policy language, with duplicate controls excluding Plans 05/06/16's closed families. |
| [06 — hybrid search](archive/06-hybrid-strategy-search.md) | 6 / 6 | **100%** | Closed with no survivor | Reopen only after a corrected mechanic changes reachable policy space |
| [07 — tooling consolidation](07-tooling-consolidation.md) | 5 / 8 | **63%** | Correctness pass complete; opportunistic refactors remain | Extract shared browser session during the next browser-tool change |
| [08 — audio-cue controller](08-audio-cue-controller.md) | 2 / 7 | **29%** | Source map and playback capture pass. A live **fail-closed, shadow-only** detector now exists on device (`ARM`/`RESULT`/`MODEL`, named refusal reasons, `UNKNOWN` for every degradation) and **cannot influence a run** — the runner sends only `GET` and reads only the visual pixel. It closes no package: the exporter is not an evaluator, close→MISS latency is unmeasurable as built, and no shadow run exists | Derive or retract the guessed `threshold=0.25`/`margin=0.05` now provisioned on the phone, then the session-split holdout and confusion matrix |
| [09 — observation corpus](09-observation-corpus.md) | 1 / 6 | **17%** | Schemas, validator and producers all landed; every runner emits a manifest on every exit path, proven against mock adb only | Validate one real captured session; the next hardware run closes package 2 |
| [10 — stock-device controller](10-stock-device-controller.md) | 0 / 7 | **0%** | Package 0 advanced: pan sourced and measured, both lights verified, office proven 1600×768 and the screen mapping derived; the right vent's scene X stays unknown | Price the right vent's ~570 ms pan round trip, then close the vocabulary |
| [11 — policy interface](11-policy-interface-and-baselines.md) | 0 / 5 | **0%** | Proposed; optional Gym package excluded from denominator | Freeze exact-engine policy protocol after Plan 09 record agreement |
| [12 — evidence campaign](12-end-to-end-evidence-campaign.md) | 0 / 7 | **0%** | Lateness decomposed and priced: the knee is the 2→3 frame boundary, and the fork-free clock recovers Nights 1–5 in the simulator; Night 7 stays blocked by the phase island | Gate A after Plans 09–11 provide their contracts |
| [13 — campaign/all-night](13-campaign-and-all-night-support.md) | 2 / 8 | **25%** | **Night 1 CLEARED on device 2026-08-26** (`n1-full-1640`, 420.2 s alive, save advanced Night 1 → Night 2). Package 3 is **advanced, not closed**: generic intro and positive 6 AM now timeline the real clear, while minigames, ordinal recognition, committed real holdouts, clock alignment and save advancement remain open. The live title has only New Game + Continue and the device owner confirmed cursor Night 2; Sixth Night is not unlocked. The 2026-08-30 run added a shadow-only labelled Foxy-cause foundation, but the operator label is not a holdout or a promotion. Current simulator ladder (1200 seeds, 95% Wilson) is 100.0% [99.7%, 100.0%], 66.3% [63.6%, 69.0%], 79.3% [76.9%, 81.4%], 73.8% [71.3%, 76.2%], 62.0% [59.2%, 64.7%], and 54.0% [51.2%, 56.8%]; this is not device evidence. The marker-123 source pass has landed (`47dcd1b`) with the engine suite green, so nothing blocks hardware | One traced Night 2 cycle, then a full graded Night 2 attempt |
| [14 — device portability](14-device-portability-and-profiles.md) | 0 / 6 | **0%** | Proposed; the canvas→screen mapping is now derived (stretch-to-fill, predicted 1720 against a measured 1700–1800) rather than calibrated | Inventory and classify the coupling: geometry, layout mode, pixel models, timing |
| [15 — sensor independence](15-sensor-independent-observations.md) | 0 / 5 | **0%** | In progress (2026-08-27, Pedro's directive: drop every screencap read, cue helper is the response). Pkg-4 instrumentation landed — `trial/08` logs paired `GRID` lines per BB read; corpus accretes on the next device night. Pkgs 2/3/5 and the grader migration open. | Same capture at `trial/06` + `trial/04`, then build the BB grid signature from the paired frames |
| [16 — constrained policy search](archive/16-constrained-policy-search.md) | 5 / 5 | **100%** | **Resolved 2026-08-27 and scoped 2026-08-28.** Pkgs 1–3 built; pkgs 4 and 5 closed by recorded negative (`740f5b0`, `4e7abce`); pkg 6 dropped. The searched Minus 7 timing/geometry space is a wall under the human gate, and the Night-7 opener is irrelevant. This is not a claim that Minus Toys, faithful RVC, GOT-YOU blackout cover, or measured machine execution was searched. | Reopen this Minus 7 search only for a device candidate or corrected mechanic; pursue the separate frontier at the top of this page independently. |
| [17 — in-APK bot](17-in-apk-bot.md) | 0 / 6 | **0%** | **Opened 2026-08-28.** Naive retail re-sign is a measured PAIRIP negative; modified-package, runtime hook, loader/shim, CCN rebuild and faithful-recompile routes remain active. | Package 1, then 2: freeze the stock oracle and localize the known re-sign failure while preparing the smallest read-only runtime-attachment probe. |
| [18 — modern tooling](18-modern-tooling.md) | 0 / 9 | **0%** | **Proposed 2026-08-28; Packages 4–5 bounded foundations landed, gates remain open.** Nine additions, each tied to a documented failure and none adding a runtime dependency or a build step. Package 4 has the phone-free 64-seed property harness; Package 5 has the phone-free parser and capture wrapper, but three current direct-HID traces had no app MotionEvent rows, so dispatch/frame landing is unproven. | Reproduce the earlier positive input-trace configuration and place each camera-select event on an actual frame landing; expand the property campaign; in parallel, Package 1 (`shellcheck` + the three footgun fixtures). |
| [19 — video reactive controller](19-video-reactive-controller.md) | 3 / 6 | **50%** | **Proposed 2026-08-29; packages 1–3 are implemented in the worktree.** The observer/controller audit fixes cover deadline timing, stale cue identity, actual mask endpoints, UNKNOWN polarity, and rejected-intent rollback. `PixelWatch.java` / `CaptureService.java` provide the native watch protocol; `watch-calibrate.py` refuses weak or foreign calibration; `reactivetest.mjs` remains green and `ventreacttest.mjs --assert` is intentionally red on the survival-cost claims. P4 now has one Night 2 observe-only baseline (operator saw Foxy; machine cause remained unknown); the run is not a clean Night 5/7 promotion gate. P5 blackout attachment and P6 external audio remain open. | Run the observe-only branch on a monitor-stressing Night 5 or 7 session, then grade it. |
| [20 — belief-state cycle controller](20-belief-state-cycle-controller.md) | 5 / 7 | **71%** | **Packages 1–5 implemented in the worktree; P6 trace contract foundation added 2026-09-02.** `src/estimator.js` preserves delayed timing, refuses stale/uncalibrated/conflicting facts, and reconciles actions transactionally. `src/cycle-library.js` and `src/cycle-planner.js` provide reviewed primitives and worst-case selection; `src/cycle-controller.js` composes them without an engine read, and the exact-engine blackout control comparison is 0/80 disabled, 80/80 normal estimator, **46/80** harsh stress, 80/80 oracle (this row said 13/80 until the 2026-09-04 audit; the plan itself has said 46/80 since 2026-09-03, when hazard preemption moved it, and `cycle-controller.test.js` prints 46/80 today). `bench-transport-trace-v1` now retains complete visual/audio latency legs and safe-cycle continuation proof in a deterministic host fixture. Physical bench timing and the shadow campaign remain open. | Package 6: real bench transport trace, then safe-cycle continuation under measured link loss. |
| [21 — policy-program synthesis](21-policy-program-synthesis.md) | 6 / 7 | **86%** | **Packages 1–6 implemented for the initial Minimal target.** The finite named-target grammar fingerprints known families; IR/device/mock-phone equivalence rejects the three Night 1 defect controls; `policy-search.mjs` persists an exact-engine positive/negative mutation frontier with provenance; and `policy-artifact.mjs` binds the canonical program to the pushed plan and manifest while keeping grading opt-in. Broader 1200-seed invention, family ports, physical device evidence, and promotion remain open. The BB-only reactive experiment remains a failing release gate; Mangle audio-static handling is modeled, but device calibration/evidence remains open. | Package 7: scoped invention campaign and promotion. |
| [22 — architecture refactor](22-architecture-and-developer-experience-refactor.md) | 1 / 10 | **10%** | **Foundation/phase 1 on branch `refactor`; counted here from 2026-09-04.** Read off [22-STATUS.md](22-STATUS.md), which is the plan's own closure matrix: P1 (workspace/core front door) is the only `Closed` row. P0, P2, P3, P4, P6, P7 and P8 are `Foundation` — the boundary or scaffold exists and each names the gate it still owes. P5 (device execution) and P9 (compatibility removal/audit) are `Open`. The plan's release rule is explicit that a green scaffold or a CLI refusal is not a physical qualification result, so no `Foundation` row earns anything here. | P5: inject a qualified transport, run bounded temporal execution, retain a real session bundle. Since the 2026-09-02 legacy deprecation this row is the only path to new ladder evidence. |
| [23 — cue helper overlay HUD](23-cue-helper-overlay-hud.md) | 0 / 6 | **0%** | **Proposed 2026-09-01; counted here from 2026-09-04.** Six packages, no closure marker of any kind in the plan. P1–P4 (ROI/snapshot contracts, overlay permission and lifecycle shell, sensor/debug renderer, decision/run renderer) are host-testable and phone-free; P5 (feasibility and interference qualification) and P6 (observe-only night, then player-facing) need the g56. The plan creates no gameplay claim on its own and defers any 10/20 use of overlay-derived human response to Plan 12's ladder. | P1: extract the versioned geometry contract from `PixelWatch` without changing its wire grammar, with the rotation/letterbox/stale/mismatch cases tested. |
| [24 — adaptive prediction coach](24-adaptive-prediction-coach.md) | 0 / 9 | **0%** | **Proposed 2026-09-01, expanded 2026-09-02; counted here from 2026-09-04.** Nine packages — P1, P2, P3, P3A, P3B, P3C, P4, P5, P6 — and **every one of them is `FOUNDATION LANDED` with its own remaining work named**, which is exactly the partial state this file gives no fractional credit for. Real substance exists (`exercise-v1` replay contracts, the `activity-gate-v1` refusal evaluator, the DOM-free microtrainer, Arcade Lab campaign/Rhythm Highway/Threat Constellation layout foundations, the skill model), but each entry ends in retained-corpus, UI-integration, or measured-qualification work. The Arcade Lab trio is called optional prose-side yet is named by acceptance criteria 9 and 10, so it counts — the Plan 14 package 6 precedent, not the Plan 11 Gymnasium one. | Close one package outright rather than widening the foundation: P1 needs only the retained-corpus join to be a closure rather than a contract. |

## Counting rule

- The denominator is the mandatory numbered work packages in each plan. Plan
  11's explicitly optional Gymnasium package is excluded.
- Plan 13 adds eight mandatory packages; the completion numerator remains
  unchanged until one of its gates actually closes.
- Plan 14 adds six mandatory packages on 2026-08-26 (77 -> 83 mandatory). Its
  package 6 needs a second handset the project does not have; it is counted
  because the plan's done criteria cannot close without it, unlike Plan 11's
  Gymnasium package which is optional to its own goal.
- Plan 15 adds five mandatory packages on 2026-08-26 (83 -> 88 mandatory). It
  exists because the same game fact is currently re-taught per capture method,
  and three more sensor-bound classifiers were added the same day.
- Plan 16 adds six mandatory packages on 2026-08-27 (89 -> 95 mandatory). It
  exists because the standing goal in item 9 has been attacked by hand twice
  and reverted twice; no search tool optimises the emitted device plan against
  `human-gate.mjs`, and the one unexplored lever (items 10/11) needs cross-cycle
  state. Overall falls 33% -> 31% on the same numerator, the honest direction.
- Plan 10 gained a package 0 on 2026-08-26 (76 -> 77 mandatory): the basic
  interaction vocabulary the schedule is made of was never established, and
  office panning appears in the record only as a failure mode.
- Plan 02 gained a package 2a on 2026-08-26 (88 -> 89 mandatory): the
  double-camera glitch turned out to exist on Android, so the Minus Toys half of
  the family needs an engine state, a probe and a device measurement that were
  never written. Its percentage falls 17% -> 14% on the same numerator, which is
  the honest direction.
- A package contributes only when its plan marks it closed, completed, passed,
  or closed by a documented negative result. Partial or “advanced” work receives
  no fractional credit.
- Plans 05 and 06 count as complete because their done criteria explicitly
  accept a recorded refutation/no-survivor result; implementation was correctly
  not started after the candidate failed. **Plan 16 closes the same way**
  (2026-08-27): pkgs 4 and 5 are recorded negatives, and pkg 6 (a
  dependency-report on a promoted candidate) was dropped because no candidate
  was promoted — 95 → 94 mandatory. Its row was also corrected off a stale
  `0 / 6` (pkgs 1–3 built in prior commits, never counted).
- Plan 05 adds four mandatory packages on reopening (94 -> 98 mandatory). Its
  original five packages remain closed; the new denominator records that the
  invention goal is active again without erasing the Six-Seven refutation.
- Plan 17 adds six mandatory packages on 2026-08-28 (98 -> 104 mandatory). The
  percentage falls 36% -> 33% with no invented completion credit; the earlier
  naive re-sign negative is starting evidence, not a closed package in the new
  route campaign.
- Plan 18 adds nine mandatory packages on 2026-08-28 (104 -> 113 mandatory).
  Each package is scoped to close either on a landed check or on a recorded
  negative (packages 4 and 6 are the likely negatives); the percentage falls
  33% -> 30% with no invented completion credit.
- Plans 19 and 20 add six and seven mandatory packages on 2026-08-29 (113 ->
  126 mandatory). Plan 19 package 1 (`src/observer.js`, `src/controller.js`,
  `tools/reactivetest.mjs` in `--engine`) closes the same day on its landed
  gate, so the numerator moves 34 -> 35 and the percentage falls 30% -> 28%.
  Plan 20 packages 1–5 are now closed by their recorded phone-free gates;
  packages 6–7 remain open.
- Plan 21 adds seven mandatory packages on 2026-08-30 (126 -> 133 mandatory).
  Packages 1–6 are now closed for the initial target by their canonical IR,
  grammar, constrained mutation campaign, compiler-equivalence checks, and
  safe artifact binding; package 7 remains open.
- Plans 22, 23 and 24 add ten, six and nine mandatory packages on 2026-09-04
  (133 -> 158 mandatory). They had been written, worked on and cited for weeks
  while sitting outside the denominator; `ROADMAP.md` named that as a
  maintenance gap. Plan 22's row is read off [22-STATUS.md](22-STATUS.md)
  rather than its plan text, because that plan deliberately keeps status in a
  separate closure matrix — one `Closed` row, so the numerator moves 48 -> 49
  and the percentage falls 36% -> 31%. Plan 24's three Arcade Lab packages
  (P3A/P3B/P3C) are counted despite the plan calling those surfaces
  "optional": its acceptance criteria 9 and 10 name all three, so its done
  criteria cannot close without them. That is the Plan 14 package 6 precedent,
  not the Plan 11 Gymnasium exclusion — the test is whether the plan's own
  goal can close without the package, not whether the prose says "optional".
- The 2026-08-30 entry closing Plan 19 packages 2–3, Plan 20 package 1 and
  Plan 21 package 1 moved the numerator 35 -> 38 for four packages. The
  correct value was 39, and every later figure inherited the error, so the
  headline read 47 while the rows summed to 48. Corrected 2026-09-04 by
  re-reading all 24 plans. **Check the rows against the headline whenever
  either changes: they are two representations of one number and they drifted
  for five days without anything catching it.**
- Prerequisite research outside a plan's numbered implementation packages is
  described in the state column but does not inflate its percentage.
- Adding, removing, reopening, or closing a mandatory package changes the
  numerator or denominator here in the same commit.
- A row is read off its plan's own completion markers, never from memory. This
  file was written on 2026-08-26, after several plans had already closed
  packages, and a same-day audit found Plan 03's row had been authored stale:
  its work item 1 closed on 2026-08-24 and the row still said `0 / 5` and named
  that finished work as the next gate. The audit also found Plan 08's "Done
  when" section still carrying a withdrawn refutation that, read literally,
  closed five packages the plan's own table lists as open.

This percentage measures completion of the written plans, not probability of a
clear. In particular, simulator success, a bounded device branch, a Night 6
attempt, a Night 6 clear, and a 10/20 clear remain distinct claims under
[Plan 12](12-end-to-end-evidence-campaign.md).

## 2026-09-09 — Night 5 loses input below the application (measured)

Two more Night 5 attempts on the Minus 3 frame-light recipe, plan byte-identical
between them. `n5-fastsync` was alive at 388.5 s of 420 — the deepest Night 5 run
so far — and lost its grade to an observation race: the frame classifier read the
auto-advancing game-over screen as `state=title` while the helper still reported
`FNAF2_GAME_OVER`. The runner now grades the death from the helper; `n5-trace`
graded cleanly at 224.5 s on that same path.

`n5-trace` was captured under `tools/device/atrace-input.sh`. On the game's own
input channel the trace holds 66 `ACTION_DOWN`, 63 `ACTION_UP`, 24
`POINTER_DOWN(1)`, 24 `POINTER_UP(1)` — and **3 `ACTION_CANCEL`**, which account
for the DOWN/UP imbalance exactly. The cancels sit 8.9 s and 10.5 s apart against
a 10 s schedule period. `ACTION_CANCEL` is the input system revoking an
in-progress touch stream: injected touches are being lost *below* the game, which
is a different failure from the mask/monitor input rules the plan compiler already
gates. Cause not identified; the same trace shows every touch copied to
`[Gesture Monitor] swipe-up`, `moto_actions_input_channel` and
`sysui_input_dispatcher`, and pointer pilfering is the standard cause — untested.

`tools/device/inputtrace.py` reports `NO APP EVENTS` on this trace despite 300
`ACTION_DOWN` slices being present: its query filters on `process_name`, which is
NULL for these slice tracks. Open defect, not fixed here; the numbers above came
from querying `trace_processor` directly.

Night 5 ledger, from the run directories rather than from memory: 22 runs have
entered a Night 5 (17 Minus 3, 5 Minus Toys), 14 produced a graded terminal,
deepest graded 369.0 s. An earlier note this session quoted "24 attempts, best
386 s"; neither number was derived, and both are corrected here.

Evidence: `docs/evidence/night5-input-trace-20260909.json`.

### Correction, same day: the cancels are the wind hold, and the trace was short

Two errors in the entry above, both found by querying the same trace further.

**Coverage.** The trace does not cover 224 s. Its last published touch is at
+115.2 s against a run that continued to +233 s: the 384 MB buffer filled and
later data was dropped. The measurement is **3 cancels in the first ~106 s of
night**, with the remaining ~118 s unobserved.

**Attribution.** All three cancels land inside the 3.2 s wind hold
(`contact(base + 5800, 'wind', 3200)`, phase 5.80-9.00 s of a 10 s cycle), in
three consecutive cycles k=5,6,7, at phases 8.72, 7.61 and 8.10 s. No other
contact was cancelled; every other contact in the cycle is 33-583 ms. Because
ACTION_CANCEL truncates a gesture rather than preventing it, the cost is 0.28,
1.39 and 0.90 s of winding, not three whole cycles.

Refuted along the way: the corrector's own taps are not the cause (its 8
resyncs fired at 25.1, 33.7, 181.7, 183.6, 189.0, 192.5, 193.4 and 201.9 s, none
within 30 s of a cancel), and system-gesture geometry does not explain these
three (wind is at (430,845), outside every measured inset). Measured but not
implicated: `mask` and `monitor` at y=1015 sit inside the mandatory bottom
gesture inset `[0,1002][2400,1080]`, and `panLeft` at x=60 inside the left inset
`[0,0][188,1080]`, with `navigation_mode=2`. Unattributed:
`onPointerDownOutsideFocus` fires 198 times, five per cycle at fixed phases,
every cycle; the slice does not name the window.

Evidence: `docs/evidence/night5-input-trace-20260909.json`.

## 2026-09-09 — The monitor raise is what fails, and the Marionette collects

A corrector-free run of the device-proven recipe (`n5-modal-once-20260909`,
edge hash `8883626783fd…`, byte-identical to the schedule that cleared Nights 3
and 4) died on Night 5 at 67.3 s. The retained video answers the question the
last three sessions have been circling.

Sampled at the middle of five consecutive wind holds:

| night | monitor | where the wind contact landed |
| ---: | --- | --- |
| 12.3 s | UP | on the Wind Up Music Box button, lit |
| 22.3 s | **DOWN** | on the office floor at ~(430,840) |
| 32.3 s | **DOWN** | on the office floor |
| 42.3 s | UP | on the button, lit |
| 52.3 s | UP | on the button, lit |

The mask was off in both failed cycles — the office is plainly visible, not the
mask overlay — so this is not the engine dropping input behind a stuck mask. The
monitor raise itself did not take, and it recovered by cycle 3 **with no
corrective taps** (`resyncs: []`). Intermittent and self-clearing, not a
permanent toggle inversion.

Two lost wind holds emptied the box before 1 AM and the Marionette killed the
run at ~60 s, recovered from the video at t=68.8–69.5 s. `windloss.mjs` at 3000
seeds prices exactly this: losing the hold entirely in three consecutive cycles
takes Night 5 from 2636/3000 to **7/3000 with puppet=2976**, while *truncating*
holds costs zero wins. The failure that matters is a press that never lands.

Candidate mechanism, measured but not established: the monitor tap (1780,1015)
and mask tap (600,1015) sit inside the mandatory system gesture inset
`[0,1002][2400,1080]`. It is not a coordinate nudge away — the drawn mask bar
spans y 992–1050, leaving ~10 px clear of the inset. Fixing it needs a hitbox
probe above the artwork, or 3-button navigation with the viewport re-verified.

Also landed: `tools/device/night5-modal-observer.mjs`, a passive dual-modality
observer (568 samples, 0 errors, round trip 73.9 ms p50 / 129.8 ms p95). Its
`monitorUp` classification is `ambiguous-threshold` on most samples and returned
exactly one `true` in 67 s of a schedule that holds the monitor up ~38% of the
time; it declares its own model as night-1-corpus and is not yet fit to drive a
corrector.

Evidence: `docs/evidence/night5-monitor-raise-loss-20260909.json`.

## 2026-09-11 — The Night 5 run was delivered at a phase no census has scored

The `campaign-2026-09-11T03-38-02.390Z` Night 5 attempt ended in `static` at
~119 s. It was not evidence about the Minus Toys route, because the stream the
phone ran was not the stream the gate scored.

The plan shipped `#phase-offset 333`, but `minusToysEmitter` replayed at epoch
0. Emitting the same winner with and without the offset changes the plan text
by exactly one line and leaves the replay summary **byte-identical**, so
`gate.replayHash` matched and the winner's `MODEL_ONLY 3000/3000` evidence was
re-certified for a rotation no census had seen. Fixed in `a44909b`: the offset
now reaches `replayToys` as `epochMs`, and minus3/minus7 — which replay at
epoch 0 only — refuse to carry one.

333 ms was also never the delivered phase. Reconstructed from the run's own
timestamps:

| quantity | value | source |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| planned rotation | 333 ms | `#phase-offset`, `hid.schedule-start` |
| prefix length `armReadyAtMs` | 1982 ms | recovered from gate 1 |
| arm release lag | **1263 ms** | `armGoAt − (released + armReadyAtMs)` |
| accumulated gate lag, 12 cycles | 0 → 116 ms | the 12 `control.gate` rows |
| **delivered steady-loop offset** | **1596 → 1712 ms** | the three above |
| origin error vs. the true 12 AM frame | **UNKNOWN**, bracket 1872 ms | lifecycle cadence |

The arm lag is structural, not a glitch: `ARM_SETTLE_MS` 600 plus two confirming
samples at `pollMs` 1000 plus the release touch, and `compileGateSegments`
resumes the parked stream on the next authored instant with no lead-in, so the
whole night inherits it. Per-gate drift, by contrast, is ~10 ms/cycle — the
`releaseTouchMs` pre-compensation works.

Why the phase matters at all: the sourced vent-mask rule accrues on
`frame % FPS === 0`, i.e. the game's absolute one-second grid. The route's mask
window is 4800 ms press-to-press, 4600 ms fully on — **exactly five grid
instants and no more**. A full-second phase sweep at frame
resolution puts the route at 4 ticks for epochs in **[416.67, 783.33] ms**, and
at 0/100 wins across every phase in that band, foxy-dominated. The
delivered offset mod 1000 was 596–712 ms: inside that band before the unmeasured
origin error is even added. Under an uncontrolled phase the route is worth
**1375/3000 (45.8 %)**, or 62.2 % conditioned on the arm landing — not 3000/3000.

Refuted along the way. The phase probe's "333 ms → 0/100, Puppet" is the
**arm sampler**, not Balloon Boy: `LAST_VIEW_SAMPLE_FRAMES` is 12 frames and
the split misses on 3 of every 12, and 333 mod 200 = 133 lands in that band
while 833 mod 200 = 33 does not. It says nothing about the mask rule. Minus 3
is not the escape: its window is `maskOnMs 9600 → maskOffMs 4400`, the same
4800 ms and the same zero margin. Widening the mask to a phase-independent
≥5200 ms makes ticks 5 at every phase but costs 300 ms/cycle of winding and
takes the mean from 46.7 % to 32.8 % — the 10 s cycle has no slack for both.
And `reactiveBB`, the reserved feedback layer, is **0/1080 on Night 5** at every
phase and at perfect, 15 Hz+100 ms, and 15 Hz+250 ms+10 %-drop observation,
puppet-dominated: it is not a drop-in.

Not established. The dump names no killer — the three `static` frames carry no
animatronic, no text, no HUD, so "BB, with Foxy" remains operator context. The
quoted "static 76 ms before the next scheduled action" compared a wall-clock
observation against a *nominal* authored time; gate 12's actual release was
120.909 s, the last `night` sample 117.657 s, and the reconstructed stream has
**no delivered contact between 116.14 s and 120.91 s** — the death fell in an
input-free window, which is consistent with a game-side interval check and not
with a mis-delivered contact. Frame `00029` shows CAM 09 and CAM 11 both
highlighted at 1 AM, so the split arm was alive 11 cycles in. The gates' 12
AGREEDs are one read each from a rule whose own tag reads
`diagnostic-provisional:night-1-corpus,animation-unproven,blackout-unproven`,
and both opening `control.effect.result` rows were UNKNOWN/insufficient-frames.

Open. The origin is a screenshot classification (`nightAnchoredAt`), and
`PhaseClockEstimator` in `packages/core/src/timing/phase-clock.js` — with the
on-device `PhaseClock.java` fitting the 500 ms winding tick — is built, tested,
and wired to nothing. Until the executor's origin is a measured game phase, a
6 AM attempt is a coin flip on a quantity the bundle does not record. That
measurement was completed by the 2026-09-11 no-offset run below; it was not a
win attempt.

## 2026-09-11 — no-offset Night 5 phase-control run

The phone ran the qualified `minus-toys` Night 5 artifact with
`phaseOffsetMs: 0` and retained a 163.432-second 1280x576 recording. The
reconstruction recovered the first delivered offset as **6695 ms** and the
last as **6872 ms**; modulo the 1-second model phase those are **695 → 872
ms**. The first five gates landed at 695, 792, 792, 799, and 799 ms, inside
the measured Night 5 loss band **[416.67, 800) ms**, where the model scored
0/100. Gate lag was 0 ms on the first gate, 97–110 ms through gate 8, then
159 ms and 177 ms on the two corrected gates.

The desynchronization entered at arm verification. Attempt 1 repeatedly saw
`cam:9=188` and `cam:11=96` but no confident highlight pair, retried at
7457 ms, and verified at 10357 ms on attempt 2. The reconstruction therefore
reports `arm.lagMs: 6695`; this is the global phase error, while the later
gate lag is the smaller per-cycle drift.

The lifecycle authority observed `state=static` and then `state=title`; the
campaign exited with `device: lifecycle left night state (title)`. The
retained video shows a Withered Chica jumpscare at 149.5 s. The new
shadow-only model reports six positive samples through 149.9167 s as
`visual-withered-chica-jumpscare`. It names the killer for attribution while
leaving the lifecycle terminal field independent.

## 2026-09-11 — phase-safe arm repeat and second-cycle correction

The camera model was updated from the live arm evidence: CAM09 read `188` on
the failed run and `183` on the repeat while CAM11 read `96`. The CAM09 rule
now records the observed selected range `183..194` and retains an ambiguity
band below the selected state. The repeat confirmed the pair twice on the
first arm attempt, at elapsed `4625 ms` and `5016 ms`, with `armGoAt` phase lag
**1320 ms** against the **2000 ms** budget.

The first cycle did not show a state mismatch: the `5200 ms` gate was
`AGREED`, with delivered offset `1320 ms` and gate lag `0 ms`. The first
divergence was at the second cycle's `15200 ms` gate: the plan believed the
mask was on, the phone observed it off, and the gate corrected it. Its phase
lag was only **70 ms**, so this is a mask-state delivery/observation mismatch,
not evidence of a large clock desynchronization. A later `45200 ms` gate also
needed correction after a grid-luma refutation.

The run is not a Night 5 win attempt: the lifecycle ended in `static` and the
retained video ended in terminal static at `80.0 s`, with no visual killer
candidate. The device was returned to the title and verified with
`items=continue,newGame`.

`77191cd0a74dcbb31022d9cb0fae747828ee295bf2dc2c40ae09ce015b59912c`.

The next physical rung is to isolate the `15200 ms` mask correction with a
short, retained first-two-cycle run before attempting a full Night 5 route.

## 2026-09-11 — the origin, not the arm, is what the phase error is made of

This session ran Night 5 twice. The first attempt never reached a night: the
2026-09-08 qualification is bound to `fnv1a-d48ce3da`, the bundle HEAD compiles
is `fnv1a-433ddeed`, and the preflight refused it in about 60 s. Pedro granted
the rebind explicitly in session; the new binding is
[qualification-hid-mediaprojection-night5-20260911.json](../docs/evidence/qualification-hid-mediaprojection-night5-20260911.json)
and it records both the plan delta (`ventl` renamed to `cameraFeedLight`, plus
one added opening row `1916 hold cameraFeedLight 100`) and the reason the old
binding broke without any plan byte changing: `validateWinner` expands the
named preset `KNOBS0` into the full knob object before hashing, so `policyHash`
tracks the knob-set shape. At 685fd01 the night-5 plan sha was still
`27aa0c15` while `winnerHash` had already moved.

The second attempt ran the rebound bundle with `--arm-observe-once`, which is
Pedro's standing direction and which the harness now takes as its default.
Observe-once starts the schedule and observes beside it, so it parks nothing
and contributes **no suffix shift at all** — the 1320 ms and 6695 ms lags the
blocking runs measured are gone. The night still ended in lifecycle static
about 50 s in.

The reconstruction says why. The delivered stream carries no internal drift:
all 25 graded transitions sit exactly on their planned offset from
`hid.night-go` (delta +0 ms through 54.4 s), which is the scheduler's computed
contact time and therefore proves the stream and not the game. What is
uncontrolled is where `hid.night-go` sits against the game's true 12 AM:
`origin.bracketedByMs` is **1852 ms**, with a lifecycle observation cadence of
p50 1986 ms and max 11301 ms. The executor's `observe` port is `lifecycle()`,
a full 2400x1080 `screencap` piped into `lifecycle-observe.py` on every poll;
the executor's own poll is 250 ms, so the residual is the capture-and-classify
round trip. Because the model's response to phase repeats on a 1000 ms game
second and loses on 53.3% of it, a bracket wider than the whole period leaves
the delivered phase unconstrained, and the model's own uncontrolled-phase
figure — 1375/3000 — is the ceiling for **any** arm mode until the origin is
pinned.

The run also measured a second, independent gap. Press acceptance graded 4
PASS, 9 MISSING, 11 UNKNOWN, 1 UNSTABLE, and the MISSING rows are not scattered:
`toys-3 monitorUp->true` (plan +10100, 900 ms after the mask-off) missed on 4
of 5 cycles, and `toys-7 maskOn->true` (plan +14400, 400 ms after the monitor
drop) missed on 4 of 5. The four PASS rows prove the grader can see a
successful transition, so these are not a blind instrument. The mask seam is
the standing explanation and `loopContactMs: 200` is already flagged in
`KNOBS0` as the experiment; neither is measured.

**Retraction.** An earlier claim in this session that Night 5 tolerates at most
408 ms of arm-release lag was wrong. It came from reading
`minus-toys-margin.mjs`'s `edge()`, which stops at the first failure and is
valid only for a contiguous basin. The response is banded: the model scores
3000/3000 at 800–1400 ms of lag, so 408 ms is one band edge and not a budget.
`phase-reconstruct.mjs` already computed `model.lossBands` and was the
authority all along. The margin tool now reports bands and says in as many
words that `edge()` must not be used on this response.

Tooling landed with it, because the measuring was the slow half of every
attempt. `tools/device/night5-run.sh` drives one attempt end to end and runs
the whole post-run pipeline plus the observed title reset from an EXIT trap, so
it happens on a pass, a failure and an operator Ctrl-C alike — it was proven on
this run's abort. `tools/device/run-report.mjs` states the executor-owned facts,
including the press-acceptance tally and any systematically missed press, which
is what surfaced gap B. And `test-grade-run-coverage.mjs`, which enforces that
no instrument exists outside the pipeline, was registered only in
`tools/test.mjs`'s ENGINE group — a lane CI never runs and one CLAUDE.md
describes as holding intentionally red controls. It had been failing on 11
scripts, `phase-reconstruct.mjs` among them, which is exactly why the last two
sessions ran it by hand. It is now in `npm run test:unit`, the lane CI runs,
and it is green.

`e8f26a0ef75732c315bf0360f7cb0d4d5d1602f9c7fcc5f1b074870f1ac33cd1`.

Open, in priority order: (1) pin the night origin from the native Cue Helper
`screen=FNAF2_NIGHT` capture timestamp while leaving the Python classifier the
authority on whether a night is running, and re-measure
`origin.bracketedByMs`; (2) measure `loopContactMs: 200` and the 198 ms
mask-off/monitor-raise separation against the 3000-seed gate, then test the
survivor on device; (3) decide what replaces the cycle gates that observe-once
removes, since blocking mode buys parity correction at the cost of phase.

## 2026-09-12 — the lost press was a lost MONITOR tap, and a 33 ms contact has no slack

The two CORRECTED cycles of night5-strokes3 had stood as "a lost mask press,
~12.5% of cycles, a Bernoulli rate no estimator fixes". The run's native frame
trace (`captures/frame-traces/night5-strokes3-20260912T035230Z-*.tsv`), read
against the compiled schedule in its own `request.json`, says otherwise, and
the reading holds at both ends of the clock bracket: in cycle 1 the camdrop's
33 ms monitor tap at +24000 never lowered the monitor; in cycle 2 the 33 ms
raise at +30100 never raised it (the wind was then held on the office) and the
camdrop at +34000 raised it instead. In both, the mask tap at +14449 arrived
with the monitor up — mask button absent — and lowered the monitor. Every mask
tap sent with its button present landed. The raise at +30100 sits inside a
40 ms capture interval at both ends of the bracket; the +24000 camdrop only at
one end, so that coincidence is reported as ambiguous.

The dump makes the mechanism legible: the flip is level-triggered with a
one-shot latch (g257 raises on `Multiple Touch` over `white button`, g258
re-arms when no touch is on `drop button`, g614 lowers via `MouseOnObject`),
so a contact that fits between two event-loop ticks is invisible and a longer
hold flips once. `MIN_CONTACT_MS` and `FUSION_POLL_MS` are both 33: mistake
register #7 one level down.

`tools/device/tap-stall-audit.mjs` now grades every scheduled contact against
the frame trace inside `grade-run.sh` (exit 3 on a lost contact) and prices the
exposure of 33/50/67/100 ms contacts to the trace's stalls: on strokes3, 1.8
expected lost taps per 420 s night at 33 ms and 0.00 at 100 ms. The peer
session bound `loopContactMs: 200` the same night; its first attempt
(`artifacts/campaign-2026-09-12T05-57-49.259Z`) ran 37 cycles with **zero
lost contacts** and died at ~370 s to something that was not a contact.
Mask and monitor luma move at the same latency for 33 and 200 ms contacts, so
the game acts on the press; the button strokes read blank for the whole hold.

Two pipeline defects fixed with it: `night5-run.sh analyze()` took the newest
`artifacts/campaign-*` directory, so night5-strokes4 (refused at preflight,
no night) published strokes3's verdict as its own — it now reads the run's own
`evidence.started` row; and strokes3 had been graded before the frame-trace
glob fix, so the two instruments that needed its trace never ran on it — it is
regraded into `grade.regrade-20260912.log` beside the original.

The hall is gradable from the same trace, and the audit now does it: the
20x9 grid cells over PixelWatch's `FOXY_HALL`, read only on frames whose
strokes say office (the retracted hall-flash-metric scored the camera screen
for want of that gate). A lit flash is two frames at luma ~45 starting 20–40 ms
after the 33 ms hall tap; dark is 0–3. Census: strokes3 (mask-off 33 ms) lit 9,
dark 6; contact200a attempt 1 (mask-off 200 ms) lit 15, dark 21; attempt 2
lit 7, dark 11. The engine refuses a flash inside the mask-off animation
(`plant-model.js` `maskFullyOff`), and the loop's hall tap at +9500 clears
that ~244 ms animation by ~56 ms — the mistake-7 shape on a third knob. Dark is
an upper bound (the light stays on during hall movement, which renders dark),
but 21 of 36 is not movement. The 372.5 s death is not the epoch: the delivered
epoch was 94.9 ± 33 ms, 21.7 ms outside the puppet band, and inside that band
the model's puppet deaths land at 28–108 s, never near 372 s. A night that lit
the hall 15 times in 36 cycles points at Foxy; no cause model fired, so that is
the hypothesis, not a finding. A `hallOffsetMs` sweep (9500–9900, nights 5, 1,
2, 6, 7, 3000 seeds) is the next model question.

Open: `camdropMonitorMs` (the peer session is taking it to 200) and the hall
tap's ~56 ms lockout slack; the helper clock is only bracketed by the gate
reads (~180 ms) and narrowed by a stated, unmeasured 30–110 ms actuation
latency — `hid-transition-probe.mjs` is the instrument that would measure it.

Closed the same session: `hallOffsetMs` 9500–9900 gates 3000/3000 normal and
worst on nights 1, 2, 5, 6 and 7 (25 runs), so the hall tap can move up to
400 ms later at no model cost; and the video cross-check of the hall grader
matches the trace census one for one on contact200a. `final2` (peer session,
contact 200 everywhere, no trace): hall lit 12 of 16, every latched mask
window 4.58 s, and the gate at +185.2 s read an unrecognisable screen before
the abort — the death, on the monitor-down/mask-up edge of its cycle, is the
Mangle shape of the shared five-tick budget at an unmeasured epoch. Evidence:

## 2026-09-12 — first Night 5 6 AM on the phone (night5-anchor2)

`night5-anchor2-20260912T204002Z` won Night 5 on ZF525F5BH5 with binding
`fnv1a-81b5e51c` (Minus Toys, bundle `artifacts/night5-contact-final`,
observe-once): `device-campaign-result-v1` attempt `WIN`, positive `sixam`
419 056 ms after the release, save advanced to the 6th Night entry,
`campaign-proof-v1` `proofHash fnv1a-e017f7c9`; 42 gates all `AGREED`, 0
corrections; the survival grader reads `TERMINAL: clear -- sixam at 449.0s`.
The run released unanchored at a drawn epoch (`k-unreachable`, delivered epoch
`UNKNOWN`), so the win is evidence for the route and the contact floors only.
Evidence: [night5-first-6am-20260912.json](../docs/evidence/night5-first-6am-20260912.json),
page [night5-first-6am-20260912.md](../docs/evidence/night5-first-6am-20260912.md).

Open: the native origin anchor is unverified (released on its aim once, at
k = 3; refused on the three runs since); the helper's onset latch clears on
in-night `FNAF2_MENU` camera views and saw no frames while a frame trace ran
(both fixed in source, not yet installed); no frame trace has yet covered a
night onset (trigger moved to `evidence.started`).

What it cost is written as its own ledger,
[night5-first-6am-cost-20260912.md](../docs/evidence/night5-first-6am-cost-20260912.md):
four days from the first Night 5 attempt, thirty run directories on the day,
seventeen nights that reached the loop, one clear; every night's gates, ending
and by-eye killer; the wrong turns priced in nights and instruments. After the
contact fix the loop ran 124 gates with zero corrections across seven nights
and won once, against a model price of 41–46 % at drawn epochs. Two of those
deaths — rep1 at a measured 885.6 ms, anchor4 at 231.1 ms (the first epoch
measured from a trace that opened before the onset) — sit at epochs the model
scores 100/100 and both lie within the stated actuation latency L (30–110 ms)
of a losing band's edge: the model's epoch is the *effective* one, the phone's
is the schedule's, and L separates them. The aim of 233 keeps the effective
epoch in the winning band only for L < 83 ms; measuring L, or aiming at 172
until it is measured, is the next question, and anchor5 at 233 is its first
read.

anchor5 answered it and asked a sharper one. The anchor is verified to the
frame (latch = trace onset to 0.0 ms, delivered 183.9 ± 40 against 233 at
k = 2, fired 0 ms from `hid.night-go`) and the night still died at +278 s
with Balloon Boy AND Mangle inside at the camdrop edge — an epoch the model
wins 100/100 for every stated L. Shifting every measured-epoch death by one
constant, exactly one value, **+233 ms**, puts all six in losing bands; at
3000 seeds it reproduces rep2, rep3, anchor5 and anchor4 with the by-eye
killers (the model records Mangle's attack as `inside-office`) and death
times inside the predicted distributions, and fails only rep1's killer
(puppet predicted; BB then Foxy re-confirmed by eye, no puppet in any frame —
a real miss, not noise) and contact200a (a dark-hall death the model cannot
produce). A latency L of ~233 ms would produce the identical shift, and the
aim-940 run cannot tell the two apart; the getevent capture on the same night
can. If the game's second grid
starts ~233 ms after the helper's first night frame, the schedule aim must be
~940, and both 172 and 233 are certain losses. One run at aim 940 decides
it: puppet death by ~108 s under Δ = 0, 3000/3000 under Δ = 233. Recorded as
a hypothesis with its arithmetic in
[night5-anchor-aim-20260912.json](../docs/evidence/night5-anchor-aim-20260912.json);
the register keeps 172 until that run. Runs are paused by Pedro.

## 2026-09-12 — second Night 5 6 AM (night5-mask5plus), and latency measured

`night5-mask5plus-aim172-20260912T220100Z` won Night 5 on binding
`fnv1a-de41e791` (Minus Toys; wind 3030, camdrop 13650, mask on/off
4249/9560, hall 9940 — a commanded mask window of 5.311 s instead of 4.751 s):
`WIN`, positive `sixam` at +419 s, save advanced, 42/42 gates `AGREED`, 0
corrections; the mask was visible 5.04–5.67 s (median 5.17) on 40 of 42
windows. Released unanchored (`authorization-late`), delivered epoch 429 ±
54 ms by the trace. Evidence:
[night5-second-6am-mask5plus-20260912.json](../docs/evidence/night5-second-6am-mask5plus-20260912.json),
page [night5-second-6am-mask5plus-20260912.md](../docs/evidence/night5-second-6am-mask5plus-20260912.md).

The run before it, `night5-aim940` (aim 940, anchored k = 1, delivered 876.7 ±
56 ms, died ~340 s BB→Foxy), measured actuation latency for the first time:
press→effect medians 253 ms monitor-up, 254 mask-on, 314 mask-off, 595
monitor-down, 64 hall; release→effect 55 / 55 / 114 / 244 / 28 ms. The
register's stated 30–110 ms is refuted; the aim arithmetic must be redone on
the measured edge the game counts.

Open: Night 6 with the winning knobs wins in the model at one phase in twenty
(Foxy/puppet elsewhere), so it cannot be run blind; the anchor has not hit a
phase since anchor5 (authorization 1.9–2.5 s after onset against k ≤ 2); the
64 ms gap between the anchored aim and the trace's delivered epoch on aim940
is unexplained. Both wins were on the Codex session of 2026-09-12; the
Claude sessions resumed from its cutoff.

## 2026-09-12 — death prediction: Night 6 died to Foxy at 26 s, the model said 60–170 s, and the gap is a measured input

Pedro asked for Night 6 on the phone as a test of the model's Foxy prediction,
and proposed that runs aim at specific deaths rather than only at 6 AM. The
run (`night6-foxytest-20260912T223944Z`, the second win's exact knobs, drawn
epoch) died to **Withered Foxy at ~26 s** against a prediction of Foxy at
80/150/170 s (p10/p50/p90) in 75 % of phases. Killer right, time wrong by 3×,
and the same run's audit says why: the post-mask hall flash at +380 ms lands
inside the mask-off refusal window (measured mask-off latency 312–315 ms plus
the 244 ms animation during which g75 refuses every office light); it graded
DARK, Foxy's D never reset, and the camdrop's held light on the monitor drop
flashed a locked Foxy. Night 5 tolerated the same swallowed flashes (13/34 and
22/41 dark on its traced runs) because Foxy at AI 5–7 needs D ≥ 14.
Evidence: [night6-foxy-prediction-20260912.md](../docs/evidence/night6-foxy-prediction-20260912.md).

Instrument: `tools/device/death-prediction.mjs` writes a `death-prediction-v1`
record before a run (killer shares and death-time quantiles over 20 phases,
3000 replays); `bundle.mjs` accepts a `DEATH_TARGETED` gate only with that
record attached and carries it in the manifest; `night5-run.sh` retains it as
`prediction.json` and prints it before the campaign. Documented in
`ON-DEVICE-VALIDATION.md` and the evidence policy. Such runs are never route
claims.

Model findings from the fix search: the raise (10100), the CAM 09 stun refresh
(10400) and the camdrop (13650) are each rigid to ~120 ms (Toy Bonnie's 6.66 s
stun); the 10 s cycle is over-subscribed by 50–150 ms once the refusal window
is real. The fit that survives: hall flash at mask-off + 600 ms with the mask
window trimmed to 5.211 s — Night 5 3000/3000 normal and worst
(`artifacts/night5-hallfix`, `fnv1a-34463603`); Night 6 a `DEATH_TARGETED`
bundle predicting Foxy 80/150/170 s in 75 % of phases
(`artifacts/night6-hallfix`, `fnv1a-44e8eff2`). Neither has run.

## 2026-09-12 — third Night 5 6 AM, and the swallowed-flash mechanism retracted by its own test

`night5-hallfix-20260912T230319Z` (`fnv1a-34463603`: hall flash at mask-off +
600 ms, mask window 5.211 s, otherwise the second win's knobs) reached 6 AM —
the third Night 5 win, 42/42 gates, 0 corrections. Its audit refutes the
premise it was built on: 22 lit / 19 dark hall flashes, the same census as
before the change; DARK uncorrelated with the cycle's mask-off latency (LIT
p50 314 ms, DARK p50 314 ms); dark flashes in runs of consecutive cycles — the
sourced g202 rendering of a held hall light while the g875–880 `hall movement`
counter drains, during which g489/g745/g855 still reset Foxy. The flashes land
and reset Foxy, dark or lit; the phone's 46 % dark against the model's 96 %
latch occupancy measures Foxy's hall presence as far below the model.
The "swallowed flash" explanation of the 26 s Night 6 death is retracted; that
death is unexplained. Evidence:
[night5-third-6am-hallfix-20260912.json](../docs/evidence/night5-third-6am-hallfix-20260912.json).

Chained on the win as Pedro asked: `night6-foxyfix-20260912T231146Z`, the
first `DEATH_TARGETED` bundle (prediction on record: Foxy 75 % at 80/150/170 s,
Puppet 25 %, no wins), died to Withered Foxy at ~238 s the instant the mask
dropped, 24/24 gates. Killer right, time in the model's upper tail (max 280).
Two Night 6 deaths, both Foxy, at 26 s and 238 s: a dispersion the model does
not have. Next death-targeting run: vary the reset cadence deliberately (skip
the post-mask flash or the camdrop light) to measure Foxy's D growth directly.
Night 5 is now 3 wins in 12 clean-contact nights; every Night 6 attempt has
died to Foxy.

**Later:** Pedro's bracket tell confirmed on the third win's video — the
bottom-left touch-hint bracket blinks +7.5..+11 when the flashlight fires with
the hall drawn dark (LIT +26 / doorway +55; FLAT +3..+4, no beam). Of the
audit's 19 dark flashes, 12 fired and 7 did not (180, 250, 260, 310, 320, 360,
400 s). Dark flashes follow a darker office (1.7 vs 3.3) and, in 13 of 19, a
mask window with an occupant in the eyeholes (0 of 22 for lit) — the room is
darker after a mask that repelled an encounter. The grid audit under-reads dim
beams; the retained video is the hall instrument. What refuses the seven is
open. Lit beams show Withered Bonnie and Foxy standing in the hall (30 s) and
Foxy in a dim beam (390 s). Night 6 (`night6-foxyfix`, same census): 13 lit, 10 blink, 0 flat — every
flash fired; dark flashes on both nights split into "dim beam, office 3.3"
(bracket +10.9) and "darker office 1.6" (bracket +7.5), two mechanisms. Encounter census on the same 41 windows: an occupant in the right eyehole at
mask-on plus a darker office after = one state (14 cycles); the next flash
was LIT 1 / BLINK 7 / FLAT 6 after an encounter and LIT 21 / BLINK 5 / FLAT 1
without. Model encounter rate 38 % vs phone 34 %: frequency right, consequence
missing. Only the six post-encounter FLAT flashes (and 250 s) leave Foxy
un-reset. A third witness, the camdrop frame (monitor just down, mask not yet on),
shows the encounter itself: the character already in the office, and who
stands in the hall. Re-indexed to the following mask window it agrees with
the eyehole witness cycle for cycle (13/13 on the win), and it found the
Withered Freddy Pedro asked for: in the office at 320 s on the win (mask
window 330 s), and standing in the hall doorway on four consecutive cycles
of the Night 6 run (70-100 s). Corpus: encounter-corpus-20260912.json. Operator verdict: the 330 s occupant IS Withered Freddy (the first Freddy
attack on the record); 210 s is Chica, not Freddy; every other eyehole guess
held and every '?' was an empty eyehole -- 19/20 for the colour rule alone,
20/20 with the camdrop witness as tie-break. Twenty labelled encounters.

Fourth Night 5 win, `night5-noflash-20260913T003456Z` (fnv1a-9f883b27: the
hallfix knobs with `hallMs 0`, no post-mask hall flash at all; gate PASS with a
prediction on record, model 2250/3000 over 20 phases): 6 AM at 419.7 s, 42/42
gates AGREED, 0 visible hall flashes by construction, masks median 5.08 s
(3 under 5.0), mask-off latency 278/307/352, monitor-down 535/600/672 ms.
This is the model's camdrop-reset credit (hallView = monitor not up during the
drop) confirmed on Night 5 at n=1, and ~620 ms of cycle freed. Camdrop
witness: 9 encounters in 41 windows (Chica 5, Bonnie 4, Freddy 0; 22 %).
Evidence:
[night5-fourth-6am-noflash-20260913.json](../docs/evidence/night5-fourth-6am-noflash-20260913.json).
Operator concern recorded there: every fixed-ROI witness assumes no office pan;
no run has panned since the monitor/mask desync fix (sourced gate: frame 3
groups 220-225, XMouse <= XLeftFrame+367 / >= +648 with viewing = 0), and a
partial pan-shift.py scan of three runs measured 0 px on every measurable
frame. Right-vent-light strategies would need the pan; deferred. Dormant Mangle
was confirmed by the operator in the top-right office corner on anchor1/4/5
(cycle before the kill), but the only detector feature tried (warm pink) is the
ceiling lamp: no detector yet.

Night 6 roadmap (2026-09-13, host-side): the 26 s death is explained (33 ms
hall contact swallowed by the phone's 307-352 ms mask-off latency, doorway
trace flat at both flashes; model floor 40 s because its mask-off is 244 ms
with no latency), and the Night 6 loss is a PHASE loss on Withered Foxy's
five-second roll grid (g337): the hallfix knobs score 0/3000 at every epoch in
[0, 1000) and 3000/3000 across effective epochs 2900-4950, perforated every
200 ms by 50 ms split-arming holes (g263). Shipped: `winner.anchorEpochMs`
(gate replays at the anchor's epoch, manifest carries it, run script refuses
to run it unanchored), `--night-anchor-period-ms` through CLI, campaign port,
fact register and run script, a Night 6 anchor aim (3600 on 5000, maxK 0,
qualified epoch 3850) with evidence
[night6-anchor-aim-20260913.json](../docs/evidence/night6-anchor-aim-20260913.json),
and `artifacts/night6-anchored` (fnv1a-bc5e044c, PASS at 3850). Corrected:
night6-hallfix's qualification-test.json claimed 3000/3000 at epoch 0 while
its manifest replay shows 8/8 Foxy deaths. Open: no phone run has delivered an
epoch in [2900, 4950]; the grid origin (first held night frame) is assumed;
the arming CAM tap latency is a stated proxy. Next physical step: run
`artifacts/night6-anchored` -- Pedro's call.

Night 6 on the phone (2026-09-13): `night6-anchored` released anchored twice
(k=0, 0.16 ms late) and died at 199 s and 219 s to Golden Freddy the second
after a camdrop. Sourced: g336 creates him on a five-second tick with the
cameras up, g778 kills when the light held through the drop meets him, g776
dismisses only at `mask` = 2. The model read g778 only on a light press --
corrected (plant-model.js); the refuted binding now scores 8/600. Second
binding `night6-anchored-b` (fnv1a-94baf687: mask off 8960, flash 9560, aim 0
on 5000, k=1, qualified epoch 5253): both five-second ticks fall between the
drop and the raise, so he is never created, and the flash precedes the second
tick. 3000/3000 across the window. Evidence:
[night6-anchored-golden-freddy-20260913.md](../docs/evidence/night6-anchored-golden-freddy-20260913.md),
[night6-anchor-aim-b-20260913.json](../docs/evidence/night6-anchor-aim-b-20260913.json).

Night 6, later on 2026-09-13 (Pedro AFK, then left with the phone): three
more anchored runs on the mask-8960 family, all inside or just below the
model's band, all dead -- b1 320 s (Foxy at the flash, below the band), c1
81 s and d2 150 s (Balloon Boy walked in; d2 at the band's centre, delivered
5175 ms by frame trace). Two measurements: the input latency is ~50 ms
(hall-lit 47; the 253 ms proxy included the raise animation) and the latched
onset leads the frame-trace onset by ~70 ms. The 4.5 s fully-on mask window
does not hold Balloon Boy on this phone; the 5.2 s window has held him in
every run. Model error open: Balloon Boy leaves short windows too easily.
Binding e = hallfix knobs anchored at effective ~4850 (0.2 s band), ready
for the next session. Evidence:
[night6-anchored-band-runs-20260913.md](../docs/evidence/night6-anchored-band-runs-20260913.md).
Audio witness map written at Pedro's request:
[AUDIO-WITNESS-MAP.md](../docs/device/AUDIO-WITNESS-MAP.md) -- every
night-frame sample handle mapped to its event group, the five open questions
each would answer (the five-second grid phase via the vent bang s0017 and the
footsteps s0025-29 first; BB inside via s0016/s0021-24; `in danger` via s0010;
death via s0012/s0062; arming via s0033), and seven offline instruments in
order. Nothing built; the BlueALSA capture is validated but not wired into the
run script, and `cue-refs` holds only handles 15-33.

2026-09-13 afternoon: the Bluetooth audio sink is connected and wired
(`night-run.sh --bt-audio`, `tools/cue/capture-bt-audio.sh --start/--stop`
with host-clock stamps, `tools/device/tickphase.py`). Binding e
(`night6-anchorede2`, delivered 4814 ms by frame trace, inside the model band)
died at 155.5 s to Foxy at the post-mask flash: the fourth such death, the
model's grid origin is the suspect (Fusion's `Every 5000 ms` runs from the
frame start, not the first night frame). First audio read: vent bang NC 0.79
but the detected bangs are endpoint bangs, not roll witnesses; WinD ticks all
present under a 500 ms fold (z 6-16 per cycle) with a linear -0.35 % clock
drift audio-vs-host that must be corrected before any phase is read.
`night5-run.sh` renamed `night-run.sh` (Pedro). Evidence:
[night6-anchorede2-audio-20260913.md](../docs/evidence/night6-anchorede2-audio-20260913.md).
Same afternoon, correction: the aptX-HD capture lost 7.6 % of its samples
(195.6 s in 211.6 s of wall), so its time axis is broken and the "-0.35 %
drift" was loss; the scream sits 7 s early. `capture-bt-audio.sh --stop` now
records `missingFraction`/`timeAxis` and `tickphase.py` refuses a phase on a
broken axis. Next capture on SBC (phone developer options). Detectability
census on the run (NC max): hall presence 0.95, blackout/signal-lost 1.00,
UI click 0.99, vent bang 0.79, scream 0.75, mask breathing 0.59, monitor
button 0.60, Mangle movement 0.54; footsteps and WinD fold-only; BB vocals
absent (he never came in). Evidence:
[night6-anchorede2-audio-census-20260913.json](../docs/evidence/night6-anchorede2-audio-census-20260913.json).
Grid origin hypothesis withdrawn the same afternoon: the g571 kill on the
10 s tick sits at schedule phase 0.2 s in the video, so the game's five-second
ticks land at 0.186 + 5k after the release -- where the model already puts
them. The mask-on touch sound (s0007, g267) is a per-cycle audio anchor
(spread 40 ms over 110 s; the 16 s loss is one early gap, not drift). The
Night 6 death mode at AI 15 is a missed D reset (post-mask flash refused by
the mask-off latency tail, or camdrop light released before the drop's
effect) followed by a 20 %-per-tick lock at D >= 6. Next instrument: per-cycle
doorway state at every camdrop and flash, beside the audio anchor.
Per-cycle ledger on night6-anchorede2 (video + audio): occupants at the drop
in cycles 5 (hue 57, unlabelled), 8 (W. Freddy), 11 (W. Bonnie); s0010 audio
onsets at the same cycles; FLAT flashes after the three defended windows;
the camdrop beam never renders. Death mechanism: cycle 13's DIM flash was the
last reset, the mid-cycle tick saw D = 6 at AI 15 (20 % lock), g571 killed
on the 10 s tick. A Night 6 route needs D < 6 at both five-second ticks.
Evidence:
[night6-anchorede2-cycle-ledger-20260913.json](../docs/evidence/night6-anchorede2-cycle-ledger-20260913.json).
Binding f (camdrop light held 200 ms past the monitor tap) died at 165.5 s
exactly as e (155.5 s): the tail is not the lever. Both ledgers show a run
of FLAT post-mask flashes before the death (the mask-off latency tail eating
the 50-100 ms before the flash press). Two aborted attempts fixed on the way
(executor refuses overlapping macros: tail 450 put the mask tap inside the
hold; the audio reader ignored SIGINT and held the PCM). Binding g = mask off
9360 (flash margin 150-200 ms), same aim. Evidence:
[night6-anchoredf3-20260913.md](../docs/evidence/night6-anchoredf3-20260913.md).
Binding g (mask off 9360) died at 195.5 s, five cycles after e/f, same
mechanism: the lock on the roll that follows the flash press by ~130 ms,
before or as the flash lands. Binding h moves the flash and mask-off 100 ms
earlier (9960/9260). Evidence:
[night6-anchoredg1-20260913.md](../docs/evidence/night6-anchoredg1-20260913.md).

Open: n=1; the per-cycle ledger and the audio anchors of the win are retained
for the next reading; the phone still streams aptX-HD (SBC pending).

Night 7 (10/20), first look after the Night 6 win: the winning knobs score
3000/3000 at epoch 0 and 8.33 ms and 0/3000 at 16.67 ms -- a one-frame band,
the model's deterministic epoch-0 case, unreachable with +-30 ms of delivery
jitter. Why: at AI 20 Golden Freddy is created on every five-second tick the
cameras are up and the held camdrop light kills him into you (g778), while
Foxy (capped 17, g829) needs D <= 3 at every tick; the only tick phase that
satisfies both is the ~100 ms between the post-mask flash landing and the
monitor raise. Search under way: a later raise (shorter wind) to widen that
window. Minus 7 (the community's RNG-proof 10/20 route) is reactive and has
no qualified device lane.

Night 7 (10/20) on the phone, 2026-09-13 evening: binding i (loop -2500,
opening wind 50, aim 2510 k=0) reached the night on the sixth attempt after
five flow fixes (save cursor, observation envelope, readback race, Ready
contact 100 ms, latch authorization) and died at ~140 s to Balloon Boy
through the mask window, then Foxy. The Custom Night configuration (Golden
Freddy preset + dial readback) is now DEVICE_MEASURED: all ten at 20,
confirmed twice. Evidence:
[night7-anchoredi6-20260913.md](../docs/evidence/night7-anchoredi6-20260913.md).
Open: the model lets Balloon Boy leave/enter mask windows differently from
the phone (the Night 6 finding), decisive at AI 20.

2026-09-13, late: the Night 7 "trace dies ~3 s before the onset" is the
runner, not the helper. On seven of twelve traced runs (i5, i6, j4-j8) the
lifecycle observer read the Custom Night dial screen (all dials at 20) as
`state=gameover`, and `night-run.sh`'s watcher pulled the trace on that label
6-8 s before the first `state=night`; the helper then ran the night on its
slow path (8 fps, 400 ms reads). Reproduced the entry without the campaign:
the trace survives the intro (5857 frames, one 1.24 s black gap). Fixed:
`screenstate.py` refuses a game over with a bright portrait band (measured
0.000 on ten real game overs, 0.215 on seven dial frames, floor 0.05), and
the watcher requires a `state=night` observation before a terminal label.
Evidence:
[night7-trace-pulled-on-dial-screen-20260913.md](../docs/evidence/night7-trace-pulled-on-dial-screen-20260913.md).
Open: the delivered epochs of those seven runs are UNKNOWN; the next Night 7
run is a measurement run for the instrument before any new band is priced.
Also this session: the Digital Wellbeing "Used for 40m" bubble was the
screen-time reminder (no app timer existed); it is off for FNaF 2 and the
Companion.

**2026-09-14, 00:48 UTC: Night 7 (10/20) reached 6 AM on the device.**
Binding k2 (all ten dials 20, puppet 15, Minus Toys; the j loop with only its
masked end extended, maskOffMs 6760 -> 7000, hall pinned 7460), anchored at
aim 2433 on the 5000 ms grid (k=0, released 2435.5, 2.5 ms late): executor
terminal sixam at 455.0 s, 42/42 cycle gates agreed, post-run title carries
customNight. Lineage i6 -> j10/j11 -> j12 -> k1 (device-refuted, dead ~20 s)
-> k2. Evidence:
[night7-first-6am-k2-20260914.json](../docs/evidence/night7-first-6am-k2-20260914.json),
run `night7-k2-aim2433-maskoff7000-20260914T004106Z`, commit 6d0a5c3. Claim
ladder level 7 (10/20 clear) has one artifact; Gate G promotion is not
invoked (no cohort, no fault-injected simulator run, no safety review).

**2026-09-14, 02:13 UTC: the Night 7 4/20 preset reached 6 AM** with the
minus3 loop reduced to four rows per 10 s (hall flash, monitor up, wind,
camdrop; no mask input exists in the plan): sixam at 453.5 s, 41/41 gates
agreed. Evidence:
[night7-420-first-6am-minimal3-20260914.json](../docs/evidence/night7-420-first-6am-minimal3-20260914.json),
run `night7-n7-420-minimal-m3-20260914T020543Z`, commit a018875.

2026-09-14, 02:30-02:43 UTC, three runs that never entered a night (all
recorded, none a route claim): `night7-m4-catalog` aborted before arming
("armMode requires an arm-verified plan"); `night7-m5-catalog` aborted at its
first action ("action clear-1 overlaps the previous HID macro") -- the Minus 7
catalog lane has no qualified run; `night6-h2-reliability` was refused by the
bundle validator with "winner hash does not match manifest" and graded as
unmanifested. Diagnosis (host, 2026-09-14): the binding-h bundle was emitted
2026-09-13 15:00; commit f00fca3 (16:03) added the `observeUntilMs` knob
default to `tools/device/minus-toys-plan.mjs`, which is in that bundle's
engine-source digest. Re-emitting the same winner.json under HEAD yields a
byte-identical night-6.plan and the same replay hash fnv1a-c651e2ff; the only
winner difference is the explicit `observeUntilMs: 420000`, the value that was
hard-coded when h won. The validator now hashes winner.json as stored, so a
later default reports as the engine-source change it is, not as a tampered
winner. The Night 6 cohort runs the re-emitted bundle
`artifacts/night6-cohort-h/bundle`; its identity to the winning binding is the
plan sha256 and replay hash above. Nothing on the phone was involved in the
h2 refusal.

Open: Plan 12 level 6 (Night 6 reliability cohort) is empty and not yet
predeclared; Gate G is not invoked; the Minus 7 catalog lane has two pre-night
aborts; the delivered epochs of the seven dial-screen-pulled traces remain
UNKNOWN.

**2026-09-14/15: the first predeclared Night 7 (10/20) cohort is complete --
binding k2 won 3 of 10 on the phone.** Predeclared before run 1
([predeclaration](../docs/evidence/night7-cohort-k2-predeclaration-20260914.json)):
ten counted k2 runs, aim 2433 on the 5000 ms grid, observe-once, no tuning.
Result ([cohort record](../docs/evidence/night7-cohort-k2-result-20260914.json),
commit f6eb1f4): 3 wins (r01b, r03, r05), 7 deaths, 0 invalid, 2 excluded (r01:
the fact register had no k2 aim, now registered from a re-run census; r07:
helper clock probe timeout, onset never latched). 3/10, Wilson 95% [0.108,
0.603]. Every release landed 0.04-1.25 ms late and every run delivered the
same loop phase by video (first CAM 11 gap 2.91-3.06 s).

The model is refuted at that phase: under the 16-bit Fusion RNG there are only
65,536 nights and k2 wins all of them at 2416.66, 2433 and 2449.99 ms. All seven
phone deaths are Withered Foxy, first visible 7.29-7.73 s into a cycle, around
the model's 7.567 s Foxy roll and just after the 7.46 s hall flash. Candidate
mechanism (not a finding): a hall flash whose effect lands after that roll;
the model cliff is 7540-7560 ms at epoch 2433 and moves with the delivered
epoch, and the model applies presses with no per-press latency. Refuted along
the way: early authorization as cause, refused-flash streaks as cause, and the
r02/r04 ledger reads (cycle-ledger.py used Night 6 constants; fixed at
d29fa6b, gated by test-cycle-ledger.py).

Also this session, host-side: seed-clock forensics
([record](../docs/evidence/seed-clock-forensics-night6-20260914.json)) --
blackout-loop onsets cannot identify a seed; in the model, full camera
positions lock a seed in ~20 s given a +-20 ms clock window, encounters in ~84 s;
the eyehole reader reproduces 12/14 corpus labels. Plan 25 records the
horizons beyond the ladder.

Open: (1) k3 = k2 with the hall flash at 7400 ms (model 3000/3000, band
unchanged, Foxy edge 2516 -> 2583 ms) needs its anchor-aim record and a new
predeclared cohort; (2) no live hall-light latency probe exists to test the
~90 ms tail; (3) the lifecycle observer reads state=night before the intro on
some runs; (4) helper wall-clock stamp at the onset latch and a twin-nights
test of clock seeding; (5) the peer session's uncommitted Minus 7 catalog lane
(custom7 target, arm-less mode) is untouched. Gate G is not invoked.

**2026-09-15: k3 won its first Night 7 (10/20) run, the helper stamps the phone
wall clock, and the striped intro card no longer reads as night.** k3 = k2 with
the hall flash at 7400 ms ([aim](../docs/evidence/night7-anchor-aim-k3-20260915.json));
run `night7-night7-k3-wallclock-r1` reached 6 AM, 42/42 gates, released 0.27 ms
late ([record](../docs/evidence/night7-k3-wallclock-r1-20260915.json), commit e00ab25).
One win, not a rate. Video beam onsets from the k2 cohort put only 2 of 7
death-cycle hall flashes late, so the late-flash mechanism k3 targets is not
the main one.

The companion now returns `wallMs` beside `snapshotNs`, and the anchor's
scheduled event carries `onsetPhoneWallMs` (9b2b017). The encounter
prediction published before grading
([record](../docs/evidence/k3-wallclock-r1-encounter-prediction-20260915.json))
was not supported, and clock seeding remains untested: eyehole identity reads
miss Withered Freddy and leave tied seeds, and neither k3's nor r03's best
seeds sit in the 0-6.9 s window a night-load seed allows. nightpredicate
refuses night on a bright full-width band at the meter's height (stripes 149.1
on six cards, real nights at most 56.6).

Open: (1) a k3 cohort if its rate matters; (2) twin nights with a Start tap
timed on the phone wall clock; (3) why the eyehole never shows Withered Freddy
on k2/k3; (4) the lifecycle frames that exist only after the intro now carry the
guard -- confirm no new false `other` on a live night; (5) the peer session's
uncommitted Minus 7 lane is untouched.

**2026-09-15: Foxy's dump chain is in the model behind an option, and it does
not reproduce the phone; the phone's Foxy deaths come in encounter-free
cycles.** Record: [foxy-chain-night7-20260915](../docs/evidence/foxy-chain-night7-20260915.json).
The Office sheet runs Foxy as an A/B chain the default model never had: the
5 s roll (g337) draws Random(5) every time and only writes A=1/D=0; A becomes 2
once B drains (g349/g364); the move and the lock (g389/g390) wait on a clear
hall latch. The default model skips 42 of ~84 Foxy draws per night and spends
one unsourced draw at construction. That leaves rates alone but scrambles
seed-specific encounter predictions: restoring the draws changes the first
encounter on ~78% of 3000 k2 seeds and the 120 s sequence on >99%.

`sourcedDropLightOrder` and `sourcedFoxyChain` (both default off; off is
trace-identical and k2/k3/h validate READY) kill k2 on 2959/3000 and 2999/3000
seeds, every lock following an encounter that blocks the camdrop flash. The
phone refutes that path: all five timed k2 deaths read an empty right eyehole
in the death cycle (base rate ~57% occupied). Chowdren's generated source
(supporting, not the Android runtime) puts g824/g825's in-danger test before
their 1 s accumulators, so D's tick pauses during encounters; the model's
per-encounter offset is unsourced. Three of seven death-cycle 7.46 s flashes
show no peak, consistent with a lost 33 ms hall contact.

Open: (1) why blocked-camdrop cycles do not lock Foxy on the phone (the paused
g824 accumulator, the real in-danger length); (2) what locks him in an
encounter-free cycle (a lost 33 ms hall contact, or a camdrop flash that did not
latch); (3) a calibrated camdrop hall-light reader; (4) the peer session's
uncommitted Minus 7 lane and configure-custom-night.mjs are untouched.

**2026-09-15: the lit counter removes the model's Foxy death path; k3 won
three twin nights; the office frame's seed moment is pinned but not
reproducible.** Records: [foxy-chain-night7-20260915](../docs/evidence/foxy-chain-night7-20260915.json),
[night7-k3-twin-nights-result-20260915](../docs/evidence/night7-k3-twin-nights-result-20260915.json).
Office events 74-83/211/382-384/426 (Chowdren real names) make lit? a
persistent counter, so a camera light held through the drop latches the hall on
the drop frame even when an encounter starts there (64cd7c5). The literal Foxy
chain then wins k2, k3 and Night 6 h 3000/3000; the phone shows 0/107 FLAT
undefended flashes, so the k2 cohort's encounter-free Foxy deaths still need a
camdrop that fails to latch, which the video cannot see.

Twin nights (predeclared be18489): A, B at Start-tap residue 20000, C at 50000;
all three won (k3 is 4/4 on the phone, not a rate). The runtime reseeds every
frame start (CRun.allocRunHeader, first call of initRunLoop, after
loadFullFrame's image/sound loading), so the office seed lands just before its
first frame, 5.0-5.1 s after the tap with tens of ms of loading jitter: A and B
started 62 ms apart and could not share a seed. Verdict INCONCLUSIVE by the
predeclared rules. A's eyehole labels are correct by eye on the reader's own
frames; the best fixed-model seeds still conflict on 3/4/6 cycles.

Open: (1) stream MMFRuntime "loading frame #:4" live to bracket the seed (the
phone's log rolls over in ~60 s); (2) a stronger seed observable (camera
positions); (3) remaining model draws out of line before seed scoring; (4) why
k2's camdrops fail to latch; (5) a predeclared k3 cohort for its rate; (6) the
peer session's uncommitted Minus 7 lane is untouched.

**2026-09-15: a k3 Night 7 carried the native frame trace; that night died at about 105 s.**
`night7-night7-k3-full-04-20260915T051327Z` kept a 6556-frame Cue Helper trace from about 3 s
before the office loaded through the death. Its only gap over 100 ms is the 1.26 s office load.
It also kept the office seed window from the live game log: 13 candidates, low16 34042-34054,
74-86 ms before the night onset. The trace was started directly over an adb forward just after
`custom-night.start`. The previous attempt (`full-03`) used `night-run.sh --frame-trace`, whose
trace start overlapped the Custom Night clock-stamp probe; the probe timed out, adb timed out, and
the campaign aborted before any night. That overlap is suspected, not proven. full-04 is k3's
first loss on the phone (6 wins, 1 loss). The cause is unidentified; its gate 11 aborted on an
unreadable mask only after the static. The 13 seeds are not scored yet; that needs a replay
harness driven by the trace's frame times and an eyehole read of full-04's video. Evidence:
[night7-k3-frametrace-nights-20260915.json](../docs/evidence/night7-k3-frametrace-nights-20260915.json).

**2026-09-15: the `hall movement` trigger is sourced, and placed instances had a third scramble.**
The APK's layout loader reads every placed instance's object handle as `readAShort() ^ 48`
(`Frame/CLO.load`), then resolves it through the item table `COI.loadHeader` already XORed
with 28. Both earlier instance rules (raw row, 2026-08-26; event handle, 2026-09-15 first
pass) left the Office without five of its twelve camera markers, which a Fusion `Set position`
silently skips; the 186/189 recompile join behind the first pass compared the chunk with
itself. Under the runtime's rule all twelve markers are placed (196/205 Office instances join
to event-referenced objects, against 154 and 158), and the approach markers form one column at
x = 668: `hall stage 1` (481), `hall stage 2` (550), `in office` (612), `got you box` (681).
`hall movement` (669, 503; 16x125, X-scaled to 14 px by g989) is overlapped only from the two
hall stages, so g875-880 arm the 300 on **entry into the hall column** by W. Freddy, W. Bonnie,
T. Freddy, T. Chica, Mangle or W. Foxy, once per continuous overlap (`C -7`), never while
standing; g881 drains it; g779, g202-209 and g1034/1035 read it. `hear footsteps` and
`close by` fall out of the same table. `readdump.py --lo-xor` (default 48) and
`test-instances.py` carry the rule; the CTFAK checkout was rebuilt from upstream plus the
ledger's Linux port and reproduces the dump byte for byte. Rung: none above FIXTURE (source
work). Open: the g881 drain expression, which `views.Active` frames the phone's LIT/DIM are,
and the entry-triggered per-character latch in `plant-model.js` with a census. Evidence:
[hall-movement-trigger-20260915.json](../docs/evidence/hall-movement-trigger-20260915.json).

**2026-09-15 (later): the entry-triggered `hall movement` is in the model, and it is outcome-neutral.**
`plant-model.js` ticks the latch every frame in `tickHallMovement` (no longer inside the Golden
Freddy hall tick, so it lives with `gfEnabled` off), exposes it as `sim.hallMovementFrames`, and
emits `hall-movement {who}` when it arms. Under `sourcedHallEntry` (default off) the 300 is written
once per entry into the hall column per character, as g875-880's `C -7` says; the legacy mode keeps
refreshing it every transit frame. Census at 3000 seeds, `epochMs` 0: device plans nights 5/6/7
699, 645, 149 of 3000 and Minus Toys night 7 3000/3000 in **both** modes, every death row identical,
and the hallway Golden Freddy never got inside in 24 000 nights -- the latch's only observable on
these plans is the hall render g202 draws while it is above zero, which is the k3 seed-lock signal
the scorer had been assuming. Gates seen green: `sourcetest` 209/209, `test:core`, `test:unit`.
`test:contracts` fails on `test-decode-once.py` (`preexec_fn`) on the committed HEAD as well, so
that lane is environmental here, not this change. Evidence:
[hall-movement-trigger-20260915.json](../docs/evidence/hall-movement-trigger-20260915.json).

**2026-09-15 (later still): the hall's DIM flash is g202's animation 99, seen.**
The dumper now emits `OBJANIM` rows (image handles per animation direction) and, with
`CTFAK_IMAGE_DIR`/`CTFAK_IMAGE_HANDLES` in the libgdiplus image (`tools/dump/ctfak-gdiplus.Dockerfile`),
writes named images as PNG. `views.Active` animation 36 (image 463) is the lit empty hall, 99
(image 570) is the hall with no beam in the doorway while the ceiling lamp still shows -- what g202
draws while `hall movement` is above zero -- and 93 (image 564) is Golden Freddy in the lit hall.
g881 drains by `1 * Global(5)`, the dt term of g535/g745/g779, so the 300 is five real seconds.
LIT = 36 or a standing character, DIM = 99 = a hall-column entry within five seconds, BLACK = light
not held. Evidence:
[hall-movement-trigger-20260915.json](../docs/evidence/hall-movement-trigger-20260915.json).

**2026-09-15 (later): the vent anchors never contradicted the phone.**
Re-read with the runtime's instance rule, the dump places `left light` at scene (147, 429) and
`right light` at (1444, 427); the phone's left-LIGHT tap at physical (350, 615) is virtual
(149, 437), inside the left box, and Shooter25's ~168 / ~1422 are within 22 units. The three light
hitboxes have Office instances (parked at y 804-844, moved or created by g1223 and g1072-1081). The
2026-08-26 "anchors off-frame, HUD laid out from code" finding is retracted; its reachability
arithmetic was right within 5% and is now sourced: the right light is centred after 420 of the 576
pan units (~280 ms in the fast band), the left light is at screen x -429 at maximum pan, so no
single pan position reaches both. Evidence:
[vent-anchors-office-layout-20260915.json](../docs/evidence/vent-anchors-office-layout-20260915.json).

**2026-09-15 (evening): a local k3 run was requested and is blocked on the bundle, and that is a defect.**
The moto g56 is on this machine's adb, `device:dry-run` passes (`run-20260915142753-b0e55bd0-4e4c57`),
the HID qualification and the Custom Night calibration are in the tree -- but the k3 binding
(`fnv1a-5c8dcb5f`, one 6 AM on 2026-09-15) exists only as `artifacts/night7-anchored-k3/winner.json`
on the peer machine, and `artifacts/` is gitignored. Rebuilding it from the recorded knob chain
(i -> j -> k2 -> k3) does not reproduce k2's plan hash (`e5259e0f...` vs `ac68e343...`) with an
identical emitter digest, so the evidence records do not carry the whole winner. None of the
thirteen `ANCHOR_AIMS` bindings (Night 5, 6 a-h, 7 i/j/k2/k3) has a tracked winner; the four
tracked `campaign-*-winner.json` are other bindings. Pedro: "the run that wins on the device, the
repository's most precious product, is not even part of it." `test-fact-register.mjs` now refuses a
register entry without a tracked winner of the same `stableHash`, carrying the thirteen as a closed
`UNTRACKED_WINNER_DEBT` list; CLAUDE.md carries the rule. To run k3 here: copy
`artifacts/night7-anchored-k3/` (bundle + winner.json) from the peer machine, commit the winner as
`tools/device/campaign-night7-k3-winner.json` (the gate confirms the hash), then
`tools/device/night-run.sh --label k3-local --night 7 --bundle artifacts/night7-anchored-k3/bundle --frame-trace`.

**2026-09-16 (night): Night 6 h won again, and the seed search now has a measured blocker
instead of a suspected one.** `night6-seedlock-h-20260916T223633Z` reached 6 AM with the game
log, the native frame trace (25,565 frames), kernel touches and video all kept. Converted to
the helper's monotonic clock, the logged 16-candidate office bracket falls 1290-1305 ms into
the trace's own 1335 ms office-load gap, 59.6 ms before the first office frame: two independent
clocks now agree on where the frame was seeded, so the bracket is not the weak link. Driving the
model with the run's own 338 kernel contacts at L = 52 ms and censusing all 65,536 seeds, the
best whole-night fit is 5 of 42 eyehole windows (seed 39435) while the bracket seeds score 16-26
and rank 1,673-57,383 -- and no bracket seed reaches a good fit at any stream offset up to 2,000
burned draws (one state at <= 6 errors against 0.98 expected by chance). The observable is not
the limit: against a known model night the true seed scores 0 and the best wrong seed 4-13
(400 targets), and the 42 windows carry 59.7 bits against the 16 needed. **The limit is that
the model decorrelates under the input-latency uncertainty at the same point the information
arrives**: a 6 ms change in L changes the night from window 11-16 (p10 = 7), 16 bits have
accumulated only by window ~16, and seed 39435's fit falls from 5 errors to 18 at L = 40, 46, 58
and 64, with a different best seed at every latency. A lock therefore needs the bits inside the
first 6-8 cycles -- a route whose monitor time surveys several cameras per raise, rather than
parking on CAM 11 -- or the per-touch registration loop pinned to about one frame. Also fixed:
g822 is an application StartOfFrame condition (object type -3, num -1), not the system Always
(-1, -1), so the model drew Paper Pals' AI every frame and spent ~60 spurious draws per second;
it now draws once, before g811. Rung: none above FIXTURE (the night is device evidence for the
binding, not a promotion). Evidence:
[night6-h-seedlock-census-20260916](../docs/evidence/night6-h-seedlock-census-20260916.json).

**2026-09-16 (same night, sizing the fix): a camera survey would name the seed in 75 s where
the eyehole route needs 190.** `n6-positions.mjs` records every unit's node at each monitor
raise; censused over all 65,536 seeds on the same run's presses, a six-camera survey
{8,7,4,3,10,9} reaches 15.08 bits and names 65% of seeds uniquely by raise 7, 83% by raise 8
(75 s) and 97% by raise 10; eight cameras reach 82% by raise 7. The route actually flown reads
2.02 bits by window 5, 4.18 by window 7 and 14.81 (49% unique) only by window 18. The survey
signature is no more stable under latency error than the eyehole (first differing raise at 6 ms:
median 9-14, p10 5-6), so the whole gain is speed: it delivers its sixteen bits before the median
decorrelation point instead of long after it. Night 6 understates this, because its three Toys
sit at CAM 9 until 2 AM. Proposed next physical test: binding h unchanged except that the
monitor-up stretch steps through those six cameras, with the lock decided on the first 75 s and
the rest of the night left alone so the run is still a graded 6 AM attempt. Evidence:
[night6-h-seedlock-census-20260916](../docs/evidence/night6-h-seedlock-census-20260916.json).

**Correction, same night:** the profile carries tap points for cams 4, 7, 8, 9, 10 and 11 and no
others, so the survey route needs **no new geometry** -- and that calibrated set beats the
{8,7,4,3,10,9} set proposed above: 15.54 bits and 76% of seeds uniquely named by raise 7, 90% by
raise 8 (75 s), 98% by raise 10. Build the route on the six cameras the phone can already tap.

**2026-09-16 (late): one seed picked out of the sixteen the clock brackets.** Scoring the
observations in time order and stopping at the first mismatch -- so lucky late agreement cannot
rescue a wrong seed -- the hall reads bound the first encounter on their own: flash 3 (44.9 s) is
lit with no blackout and window 4 (49.2 s) shows Withered Chica, so the night's first encounter
began between 44.9 and 50.5 s and it was Withered Chica. Of the 656 (bracket seed, latency) pairs
only 34 reproduce that, all of them seeds 51380 or 51381 and all at L >= 68 ms -- which refutes
the 52 ms this run's monitor-to-static measurement gave and agrees with the k3 night's 83 ms.
51381 then fails at observation 3. **Seed 51380 tracks the phone for 16 consecutive observations,
to about 85 s, while every other bracket seed stops at 8 or earlier, at every latency from 68 to
100 ms.** At a fixed L = 84 ms only 0.496% of all 65,536 seeds reach an unbroken prefix of 16, so
the odds within the bracket are about 13:1 for 51380. That is a **pick, not a lock**: the global
best prefix over the whole seed space is 26, outside the bracket, so the model is still unfaithful
enough for chance to beat the truth over a full night. Two defects are now isolated: the model's
encounter timing slips whole 10 s cycles (three of 51380's cue pairs land exactly on the phone's,
others sit one cycle out), and at L >= 68 ms Foxy's g573 kills at 225-265 s on a night the phone
won. Fixing the cycle slip is the shortest path from pick to lock. Evidence:
[night6-h-seedlock-census-20260916](../docs/evidence/night6-h-seedlock-census-20260916.json).

**2026-09-16 (last): the seed is picked by timing the first frame, and two earlier nights collapse
to a single candidate.** Read from classes.dex, `CRunApp.startTheFrame` logs "Starting new frame"
at instruction 42, runs `MMFRuntime.updateViewport` at 113 (its block ends "Setting renderer
limits..."), and only calls `CRun.initRunLoop` at 231 -- whose **instruction 0** is
`allocRunHeader`, the one `currentTimeMillis` that becomes `rh3Graine`. Everything that logs from
inside initRunLoop is therefore after the seed: `createFrameObjects` (29) reaches
`CExtLoad.loadRunObject` and prints "Created extension: ", and `f_InitLoop` (57) prints
"iPhoneOptions are ". So the seed sits between the last line before initRunLoop and the first line
inside it, which is one or two milliseconds -- not the 13-16 ms of the "Starting new frame" to
next "startTheFrame() called" pair the tool used. Re-derived on every retained log: tonight's
Night 6 **16 -> 2 (51376 or 51377)**, k3 full-07d 15 -> 2, twin A 13 -> 2, and **k3 full-06
14 -> 1 (47593)** and **k3 full-04 13 -> 1 (34043)** -- two nights named outright by the clock.
This **retracts the 51380 pick** made earlier tonight: 51380 is four milliseconds past the first
"Created extension" line, so it was the 7% false positive its own statistics allowed. It also
sharpens the model's defect to a single sentence: for the clock's candidates the model puts the
first office encounter at 78.8 s, the right character three cycles after the phone's 49 s.
`office-seed-bracket.py` applies the sourced rule by default, keeps the old one behind
`--legacy-pair`, names the rule it used, and its test (in `test:contracts`) covers both.
Evidence: [night6-h-seedlock-census-20260916](../docs/evidence/night6-h-seedlock-census-20260916.json).

**2026-09-17: a timed start for Night 6, and the seed forced to a three-millisecond cluster.**
`FNAF_START_PHONE_WALL_RESIDUE_MS` now governs a story night's title press, sharing the stamping
and refusal path with the Custom Night Start tap. On an idle host the press lands **0.007 ms** from
the planned phone wall instant; on a busy one it drifts 20-40 ms, and that error goes straight into
the seed. Three attempts taught the ordering the hard way. The title cursor survives an attempt, so
the first press sometimes activates the row and sometimes only focuses it, and only the
**activating** press fixes the seed -- it follows by a steady **4849 ms**, 3556 to the office load
and 1293 through it. Waiting to observe which press activated is not allowed: `intro()` stamps the
instant after which a latched onset counts as this night's, and the office appears 4.8 s after the
activating press, so two perfectly placed presses were refused as `onset-predates-intro` before the
ordering was understood. The press is now placed and the phase returns at once, and
`timedStartHeld` reads back from the seed which press did the work.

Cohort 1 (three nights) spread 1906 ms because half its nights were started by the untimed second
press; it was stopped at three of its eight allowed attempts because those three showed eight could
not produce a twin. Cohort 2 runs the corrected start. Aimed nights land their seeds in a
**3 ms cluster** (24850, 24851, 24853), and `night6-c2-01-20260917T021417Z` reached **6 AM with its
office seed named to a single millisecond, 24851** -- the first 6 AM in this project whose seed is
known exactly. Twins still need two attempts on the same millisecond: the measured window is 37 ms
of delay plus the press error, about eight attempts on an idle host.

Two tool corrections worth keeping. The seed is the low 16 bits of the wall clock, so attempts a
whole number of 65,536 ms periods apart share a seed while their absolute milliseconds differ; the
first twin detector grouped by absolute time and would have missed a real pair. And
`twin-compare.py` reads a night's 42 mask windows from the video alone, aligning on the cameras-up
statics rather than on any model: it agrees with the corpus hand read on 40 of 42 windows, and both
differences are misses rather than wrong characters, so true twins should agree on about 38-40.
`night-run.sh` gained `--no-grade` so a cohort is not serialised behind an 18-minute pipeline.

predeclared in [night6-twin-nights-predeclaration-20260916](../docs/evidence/night6-twin-nights-predeclaration-20260916.json).

**2026-09-17 (same night): the phone's wall clock is settable without root, and pinning it is the
lever that would finish twin nights.** `adb shell date -s` is refused, but
`adb shell cmd alarm set-time <epochMs>` works from the shell: tested, the clock moved by the
requested amount and was restored to within 6 ms of the host. Hooking `currentTimeMillis` inside
the game is not available without root or repackaging, and a repackaged APK would change the
target every qualification names. Setting the clock does not by itself beat the seed jitter -- the
uncertainty lives between any anchor we control and the game's own read, and the nearest log line
before that read is 1-15 ms ahead of it, shorter than the 46-62 ms an adb round trip costs. What
does help is **pinning**: loop the set so the uncertainty becomes the set period instead of the
natural 40 ms. One `cmd alarm set-time` costs 34 ms in an on-device loop, which does not beat it;
**eight parallel on-device loops hold the clock a median 7 ms above the pin (p90 23, max 38), and
each sample's own `date` spawn costs 10-25 ms of that**, so the true pin is tighter. Next: pin
through the office load at a seed already held by a completed night, measure the resulting seed
distribution before spending nights on it, and stop the matching attempt at about 120 s -- a full
night is not needed to compare encounters. Evidence:
[night6-twin-nights-result-20260916](../docs/evidence/night6-twin-nights-result-20260916.json).

**2026-09-17: the model gap, measured on a night the phone won.** `night6-c2-01-20260917T021417Z`
reached 6 AM with all 42 cycle gates agreeing and its office seed named to a single millisecond
(24851). No frame trace was kept and none is needed: the plan is deterministic, every gate agreed,
and the release instant and the seed instant are the same phone wall clock, so the presses sit
6347 ms after the model's frame 1. **At its own seed the model dies at 150.2 s to Golden Freddy,
and censused over 600 seeds on the same presses it dies in all 600** -- 368 Foxy, 220 Golden
Freddy, 12 inside-office. With Golden Freddy disabled it still dies in all 600: **551 Foxy**, 46
inside-office, 3 Puppet. So this is not a seeding artefact; no seed survives a route the phone
survived, and both dominant causes are hall-flash kill rules on a route that flashes every cycle.
A lead on the Golden Freddy half: g336's fifth condition is `mmonitorUp.Active` **invisible**
(mmfparser condition -28 is ObjectInvisible), which the model folds into `monitor === MON_UP`; if
that sprite is visible while the monitor is up, the source creates him far more rarely than the
model does. Foxy is the bigger fish at 92% of the remaining deaths. The pass mark for any fix is
simple: some seed must survive this route. Evidence:
[night6-h-seedlock-census-20260916](../docs/evidence/night6-h-seedlock-census-20260916.json).

**2026-09-17: the model gap was two wall clocks, not a Foxy rule.**
The model killed all 600 censused seeds on `night6-c2-01`, a Night 6 run that reached 6 AM with 42 of
42 cycle gates AGREED. Before moving anything, every group that can produce that death was read out
of the event dump and compared line by line: `lit?` (g75-g96), the hall latch (g488/g489), the 5 s
roll (g337), the A/B chain (g349, g364, g389, g390), the kill (g573), exposure and retreat (g745,
g846), the pin (g855) and all four D terms (g824, g825, g864, g872-g874). Every one is a faithful
transcription -- including `100 * night` and `500 + Random(500)`, and the fact that g573 commits
`being attacked by = 4` which nothing in frame 3 ever writes back to 0. So no rule was wrong.

The presses were. `phase.json`'s origin and every gate's `reachedAt` are stamped on the **host's**
wall clock; the office seed is read out of the phone's logcat on the **phone's**. On this run the two
stood **1374.8 ms** apart, so the reconstruction placed the whole schedule 1.37 s late against the
game's own clock -- and 6347 ms is nearly the worst phase available, 1477 ms from a surviving band.
Survival is a **240 ms band that recurs every 5000 ms**, the movement-roll period: swept -1000 to
+10000 ms at 100 ms steps, nothing outside those bands lives. Corrected to one clock the origin is
**4972.2 ms**, and the anchor's own record predicts 4972 independently (aim 4870, fired 0.73 ms late,
10 ms handoff, its phone-wall onset estimate 91.2 ms after the true seed). The model then reaches
6 AM on **all 65,536 seeds** -- the whole space, with no death of any cause.

`phase-reconstruct.mjs` now names the clock and carries a `phoneWall` block with the skew, derived
from the anchor's own two conversions of the same onset, so the comparison cannot be made silently
again; a run without an anchor reports `null` rather than a guess. Still open and load-bearing: the
census assumes a constant 16.667 ms frame, and the route lives at 16.6667 and 17.00 ms but dies at
16.60, 16.64, 16.70, 16.80 and 17.065. `night6-c2-01` was run `--no-trace`, so the phone's real frame
deltas do not exist for it. The next physical test is that binding re-run with `--frame-trace`.
Evidence: [night6-model-gap-two-clocks-20260917](../docs/evidence/night6-model-gap-two-clocks-20260917.json).

**2026-09-17: all ten Custom Night presets, 3000/3000, and the 50 ms floor that found.** Night 7
in this repository had only ever meant canonical 10/20; the other nine menu presets are different
AI vectors on the same night-7 rules and had never been asked. `night7-presets.mjs` asks them, at
the golden standard, in two lanes -- exact delivery, and the same presses through `actuator.mjs` --
with the presets read from the calibrated menu model the phone's dial driver sets rather than
retyped. **All ten clear 3000/3000 in all four lanes (exact, exact worst, device, device worst):
120,000 simulated nights, no loss**, at a band wider than the phone's own worst measured spread.

The ten green rows are not the finding. Getting them required moving one knob, and the reason is
the mistake register's item 7 in a new place. `KNOBS0.hallOffsetMs` = 9500 puts the Foxy-reset hall
pulse 300 ms after the mask-OFF press; `MASK_ANIM_OFF` is 250 ms and `lit?` needs `mask` = 0 (g75),
so **the pulse cleared the animation it depends on by 50 ms** -- narrower than the phone's own
per-cycle displacement, fitted at **44.6 ms span on k3 full-04 and 81.5 ms on full-06** from the
retained frame traces. When the gap closes there is no light, Foxy is never reset, and he takes the
night: at a 0-100 ms band the shipped offset is 107/200 on 10/20 and *every* loss is `foxy`, while
the exact lane stays 200/200 -- which is exactly why no existing gate saw it. `hallMs` was swept
33..200 ms first and scored **identically at every value**, the item-10 signature: the pulse's
length is not the mechanism, its placement is. 9613 is the centre of the plateau measured across
offset x epoch, `[9542, 9683]`, clearing each edge by ~70 ms. The lower edge has a mechanism and
the arithmetic agrees with it (9200 + 250 + 82 = 9532 against a measured 9542); **the upper edge
does not**, and is recorded as a measured edge rather than dressed in an inequality that would pass
at 9700, which the +11f epoch column measures as a loss.

One more thing the epoch scan settles. Across 12 epochs x 10 presets at 300 seeds, **wins equals
armed in every single cell, and the armed counts are identical across all ten presets** (300, 274,
232, 166, 137, 122, 125, 168, 223, 277, 300, 300). The split arm depends on the schedule and the
epoch, not on the AI dials, so under the measured band the only thing that costs any preset a night
at any epoch is a missed arm -- the branch the emitted plan already closes on the phone with
`#arm-verify`. There is no preset-specific device failure left to find in the model.

Scope, stated plainly: **this is MODEL_ONLY and no phone was run for it** (Pedro's instruction for
the session). It does not touch the model gap measured earlier today on a Night 6 the phone won.
The physical test it implies is one graded Night 7 run on a preset other than 10/20 at
`hallOffsetMs` 9613. Evidence:
[night7-preset-sweep-20260917](../docs/evidence/night7-preset-sweep-20260917.json).

**2026-09-18: Night 5 reached 6 AM again, from a bundle re-emitted against the current engine.**
`night5-n5-carry-aim172-20260918T012153Z` won Night 5 on the phone: 42 of 42 gates AGREED, 0
corrected, `state=sixam` observed. The 2026-09-12 `night5-contact-final` bundle is now refused at
preflight for a stale engine source hash, so its winner was re-emitted; `night-5.plan` and
`profile.json` are byte-identical and the manifests' replay, gate, plans, policy and nights sections
match (replay `fnv1a-afa3aafd`). The binding hash moved from `fnv1a-81b5e51c` to `fnv1a-f430f190`
only because the current emitter writes the default `observeUntilMs`, the same cause that moved
binding h on 2026-09-14. The qualification was carried forward on that equivalence at Pedro's
request, the anchor was passed explicitly at the register's aim of 172 ms, and the release still
came out unanchored (`authorization-late`), as both earlier Night 5 wins did. The winning binding is
tracked as `tools/device/campaign-night5-contact-final-winner.json`. Not yet graded; one night is
not a rate. Evidence: [night5-sixam-carry-20260918](../docs/evidence/night5-sixam-carry-20260918.json).

**2026-09-18: proven twin nights, a writable seed, and the model on the phone's own frame clock.**
Twins by the predeclared rule: `night6-tw-12-20260918T022134Z` and `night6-twin-01-20260917T014037Z`
both bracket their office seed to one millisecond at low16 **24850**. The second was forced by a
device-side clock pin (`tools/device/seedpin/`): when the phone's log shows the office loading, a Java
pinner run through `app_process` holds the wall clock at a value congruent to the target until the
first post-seed line, then restores real time. It is needed because the tap-to-seed delay spreads
over 150 ms across 13 attempts, and 137 ms of that is the office load itself. Its floor is the
platform's: each set is `settimeofday()` plus a hardware RTC write under a lock, ~6.5 ms and
serialised, so the seed lands in a seven-value window and a chosen value about one time in five.
The twins did **not** replay the same night: at about 1 AM Balloon Boy got into the older night's
office (then Foxy), while the pinned night had Mangle. Their input phases differed by 86 ms, the
model at each night's own phase reproduces that split, and with seed and presses fixed the frame
clock alone reshuffles the windows from about cycle 8. Separately, on two frame-traced nights the
model driven by the phone's own frame intervals predicts survival at each night's seed and phase,
closing the frame-clock item left open on 09-17. Also fixed on the way: the timed start's
focus-versus-activation race (`b63ead9`), and loop aborts that never landed (SIGINT to a background
job is ignored). Next: a same-phase twin with both eyeholes read. Evidence:
[night6-twin-nights-proven-20260918](../docs/evidence/night6-twin-nights-proven-20260918.json),
[night6-model-traced-clock-20260918](../docs/evidence/night6-model-traced-clock-20260918.json).

**2026-09-18: the model does not know the encounters, and the gap is not an offset.** On the traced
Night 6 6 AM `night6-tw-04-20260918T014915Z` the phone shows 11 occupied mask windows out of 42; the
model at that night's own seed, frame trace and phase matches 2. Stepping the seed up to 300 draws
either way reaches at best 8 of 11, which is also the best of 1,202 random seeds, so the offset fit
is at chance. The gap is systematic: across every seed the model's nights carry a median 17 occupied
windows and start about two cycles earlier, and the excess is Withered Chica and Withered Freddy
(video frames confirm an empty office where the model has its first encounter). Night 6 outcomes
are right because the route survives every encounter the model throws, not because the model
knows them; on Night 7 the model kills both traced k3 nights, including one the phone won. Next is
rule work on those approaches and entries, not a seed search. Evidence:
[model-encounter-fidelity-20260918](../docs/evidence/model-encounter-fidelity-20260918.json).

**2026-09-18: the predeclared k3 Night 7 cohort -- 8 of 10 nights to 6 AM.** Ten runs of binding k3
(`fnv1a-5c8dcb5f`, Night 7 10/20) under the predeclared protocol, no tuning inside, none excluded or
invalid: 8 wins, each executor `sixam` and video TERMINAL clear (453-456 s of recording), and two
deaths, both Withered Foxy on the first office frame after a mask-off press, 20.0 s and 70.2 s into
the night (r03, r04; read frame by frame, since the recordings stop before a game-over screen). The
anchor landed 0.06-1.05 ms after its 2433 ms aim on every run. This is one ten-run measurement of
one binding; the model predicted no rate for it. The deaths point at the hall flash scheduled
400 ms after mask-off against a 314 ms median press-to-effect plus the mask animation: a later
flash is a new binding and its own cohort. Evidence:
[night7-cohort-k3-result-20260918](../docs/evidence/night7-cohort-k3-result-20260918.json).

**2026-09-18: the in-game overlay teaches the cycle.** The Cue Helper now has a teach panel for
someone watching the bot: a 580x100 window at the left of the office with a ring for the 10 s
cycle (the surface the schedule intends, the flashes and the wind, a hand for now), the step it
is on, why that step is there, the time left, the next step, the hour, and `seen`, which is the
helper's own reading of the bottom controls. `night-run.sh --teach-overlay` uploads the compiled
artifact's semantic actions at the menu and the anchor's release interval after it, so the panel
narrates from the helper's own latched onset with no host clock involved. The words are a fixed
vocabulary in the APK. The panel is drawn only where nothing reads the frame. A Java test drives
every native reader over a recording frame, and a host test checks the night predicate, the
lifecycle boxes, the grader's bands and every control point. The two helper readers that cannot
avoid any rectangle are withheld while the panel may be on screen. On the phone `night7-k3-teach-02`
won with the panel narrating all night: 42/42 gates agreed, the anchor 0.17 ms late, video
TERMINAL clear with the rectangle blanked. The window sat exactly at [10,310][590,410], but at
alpha 0.8, not 1.0: the platform caps untrusted overlays, so a teach video is always graded with
the rectangle blanked. The first attempt ran without a panel because of a lookup bug, now fixed
and pinned by a test; that night won anyway. Evidence:
[teach-panel-night7-20260918](../docs/evidence/teach-panel-night7-20260918.json).

**2026-09-20: Night 6 again, and the 189 ms the mask never had.** Binding h — 42/42 and a 6 AM on
2026-09-13 — died twice tonight, at 213 s and 307 s, and the retained video names both killers.
At 213 s Balloon Boy was in the office and Withered Foxy took the run: `plant-model.js:677` sets
`hallLit = false` while `bb.inside`, so the 9960 hall flash had been a no-op for minutes. That also
answers the open "0 visible hall flashes in 43 intervals" reading — after BB is in, there is nothing
to see, and raising `hallMs` would have been a fix priced against a symptom. At 307 s it was Mangle.
BB (g907/g292/g294) and Mangle (g400/g401) are repelled by the same counter: five continuous
fully-masked one-second ticks. h holds the mask fully on for 9260 - 4249 - 200 = 4811 ms, and five
whole-second boundaries fit in 4811 ms only at a lucky phase — at the delivered aim the fifth tick
cleared the mask-off press by 131 ms of *game-frame* time, because the counter advances on
`frame % 60`. Eight dropped frames in a cycle and the cycle silently delivers four. The floor was
already in the tree for the other strategy: `test-runner-plan.mjs:165` pins the minus7 driver's
`MASK_RESPONSE_HOLD_MS` to `MASK_ANIM_ON/FPS + VENT_MASK_TICKS` = 5200 ms, and minus-toys had never
been measured against it. **h2 is h with `maskOffMs` 9260 -> 9560 and nothing else** — 5111 ms fully
on, five ticks at every phase — and it reached 6 AM on the first attempt (42 cycle gates, anchor
delivered at aim 4870 with `lateMs` 0.418), **unlocking Custom Night**. The 300 ms came out of the
idle gap before the flash, not a wind hold: the variant that bought 200 ms more by shortening
`windMs` 3030 -> 2830 scores 68/3000, which is where Pedro's "more mask means less winding" stops
being available on Night 6. Two gates that were not gates were closed alongside it. `ANCHOR_AIMS` is
keyed on `stableHash(winner)`, which moves when an unrelated KNOBS0 default is added; `observeUntilMs`
gained one, so the committed h winner — byte-identical plan, `fnv1a-c651e2ff` — resolved to no aim for
five days while the migration sat in `UNTRACKED_WINNER_DEBT` prose that nothing read, and every Night 6
attempt since was hand-fed 4870/5000/0 through the environment. Entries now declare `alsoBinds`, and
`test-fact-register.mjs` re-emits the named winner to prove the plan still hashes to the entry's
`replayHash`. And `gate.replayHash` hashes the *model's* event traces, not the plan: h and h2 share
`fnv1a-c651e2ff` despite different plan text, so gates may now declare `planSha256` (optional, because
adding it to a shipped winner would re-hash that winner and orphan its aim exactly as above). Still
open: h2 is one run, not a cohort; the runs are `--machine-only`, so no Plan 12 promotion edge — though
`artifacts/night6-anchored-h/` on this machine holds a DEVICE_MEASURED qualification bound to the
pre-drift hash, which CLAUDE.md records as living on the peer machine. Evidence:
[night6-five-tick-mask-window-20260920](../docs/evidence/night6-five-tick-mask-window-20260920.json),
[night6-anchor-aim-h2-20260920](../docs/evidence/night6-anchor-aim-h2-20260920.json).

**2026-09-20: the second game's results enter custody, and a control map learns where a control
is.** Three FNaF 3 sessions from this morning -- the title-gate negatives, the zero-input Night 1
6 AM with the first control actuation, and the control surface -- had been committed as plan prose
with no evidence file and their frames under gitignored `captures/`, which is the FNaF 2 custody
hole being dug in a second place. They are now derived records
([title gates](../docs/evidence/fnaf3-title-gate-negatives-20260920.json),
[first night](../docs/evidence/fnaf3-first-night-20260920.json),
[control surface](../docs/evidence/fnaf3-control-surface-20260920.json)); the frames stay local,
because the publishing boundary is what makes the derived half committable at all. None is a Plan 12
rung and each says so.

The first record carries a defect that nearly erased the run that found it: the ad-hoc capture loop
force-stopped FNaF 3 **during the post-night minigame**, and FNaF 3 happens to bank the night before
that sequence rather than after it. `tools/device/game-teardown.sh` is the rule where a tool reads
it -- `--after-night` stops a game only once `title-observe.py` has read the title, because that read
is not a proxy for the save but the save itself (Night 1 was graded by exactly it: `LOAD GAME 2`).
There is no settle constant in the file for that reason. The deadline is a bound, not a measurement,
and exceeding it leaves the game **running**: a phone parked on a minigame is recoverable, a
force-stop through a save write is not. Eight mock-ADB checks, whose load-bearing assertions are
negative -- on a timeout, an unfocused game, a missing model and every usage error, no force-stop
reaches the phone.

Then Plan 26 blocker 1, whose schema half is now closed.
`packages/adapters/src/control-anchor.js` gives each `controlMap` entry an anchor kind and, for a
world-anchored control, the pan its coordinate was read at; both actuators resolve through it and
every accepted press now records the view offset it assumed, which is the half that made historical
press coordinates unreadable rather than wrong. An **unstated** anchor resolves at rest and refuses
anywhere else, so the Minus 3 pan hazard becomes a refusal instead of a coordinate nobody measured.
FNaF 1 is the vehicle, as the plan ordered: its map is the first with anchors, its five control roles
are newly registered, and `test-control-anchor.mjs` derives the 2780 px door separation from the map
rather than trusting the 2779 in the plan's prose. Still open, and it is the interesting half:
nothing reads the live pan -- `view-scroll-v1`'s own `panObservation` is `UNKNOWN(not-implemented)`
-- so the offset is stated by a caller, not reported by the phone; and the four pan-dependent FNaF 2
controls stay unmigrated on purpose, because a profile's bytes are hashed into the bundles bound to
it. The test pins those four so migrating them is a deliberate edit.

Touching `packages/core/src/control/` woke a gate that had been red for eleven days.
`tools/policyequivalencetest.mjs` -- the Plan 21 compiler-equivalence regression -- was registered
only in `tools/test.mjs`'s ENGINE group, which CI does not run and whose reds CLAUDE.md excuses as
intentional scientific controls, so two real defects sat behind it. `e8af711` (2026-09-09) renamed
the control vocabulary and left `policy-equivalence.mjs`'s accepted-action set reading `light` and
`ventl`; `3efc923` (2026-09-11) then put a `cameraFeedLight` row in the opening (the first safe Toy
stun) and took the plan from 183 to 185 events without updating this file's count. Both are fixed:
the action set is now DERIVED from `DEVICE_CONTROL_NAMES` instead of hand-copied, and the count is
185 with the commit that moved it named beside it. A third defect fell out of the first -- the
comparator identified a camera by `startsWith('cam')`, so `cameraFeedLight` became the camera
`cam:eraFeedLight`, which is what a prefix match does the moment a vocabulary grows a longer name.
The gate is now in `npm run test:unit` as well, which is mistake register entry 13 for the second
time.

Gates: `typecheck`, `test:unit`, `test:contracts` and `test:affected` green; catalog and docs
regenerate (386 tool scripts carry an entry). No rung moved and no device was touched -- `adb
devices` is empty.

**2026-09-21: FNaF 4 model and held-out census.** Resumed the interrupted OpenCode modeling
session and completed the FNaF 4 host model: the 80-point black flash, idle accelerants, bedroom
and closet chains, Fredbear room/forced-turn paths, and shadow Nights 7–8 are now represented in
`sim-fnaf4.js`, with `community-loop`, `no-audio`, and failing controls in `policy-fnaf4.js`.
The deterministic FNaF 4 check is registered in `npm run test:unit`.

The published `community-loop` is **MODEL_ONLY**: it clears Nights 1–4 in both 3000-seed blocks,
scores 53/3000 and 56/3000 on Night 5, 1309/3000 and 1361/3000 on Night 6, and 0/3000 on Nights
7–8. The held-out block is seeds 3000–5999, selected with the new `census.mjs --start` option.
`do-nothing` now fails every night to the black flash, so the former dead-control gap is closed.

Result record: [`FOUR-GAME-NIGHTS.md`](../docs/research/FOUR-GAME-NIGHTS.md) and
[`FNAF4-AUDIO-INDEPENDENCE.md`](../docs/research/FNAF4-AUDIO-INDEPENDENCE.md). Evidence ID:
**none** — this was a host model run and no device was touched. Open: resolve the model's
`UNKNOWN(walk-cadence)`, `UNKNOWN(listen-pair)` and timing assumptions, find a held-out route for
Nights 5–8, then complete the dry-run/device path before any Plan 12 promotion.

**2026-09-25: FNaF 1 4/20 reached 6 AM on the phone, on the first attempt.** Custom Night 20/20/20/20,
the hardest mode FNaF 1 has: the night ran to its end, the helper's native frames read `5 AM` rolling
to `6 AM`, and the title came back with a third star. Evidence
[`fnaf1-420-first-6am-20260925`](../docs/evidence/fnaf1-420-first-6am-20260925.json); binding
[`fnaf1-custom-night7-420-grid420-winner.json`](../tools/device/fnaf1-custom-night7-420-grid420-winner.json).
One night, not a cohort, and no Plan 12 edge.

What it took, in order. The FNaF 1 census had been scoring policies that write simulator state
(a one-frame light, a free pan across a 2780 px door gap), so `Fnaf1Sim.press` now applies the event
sheet's input rules and `tools/fnaf1-device-lane.mjs` drives it at the handset's costs; the
idealised 3000/3000 is relabelled in `FOUR-GAME-NIGHTS.md`. The route `grid420` is the 2026
community 4/20 line (CAM 4B flicks for Freddy and Foxy, light checks, Chica only via 4B) put on the
three roll grids, with Pedro's play folded in: the reopen is decided by the light through the shut
door. Observation moved off screencap and luma entirely: the Companion gained `REGION` (raw
pixels of registered native rectangles, every frame) and `SNAP` (a native frame for menus), and
a 0/0/0/0 calibration night measured what the route then used -- lights and doors act on
touch-up (166-247 ms), the monitor on touch-down (8-52 ms), the hour is 90 s, the origin is the
first office frame minus ~97 ms, and a still room renders identical frames. A 0/20/20/0
positive-control night then caught one real defect before 4/20 did: a flickering lit frame with
Bonnie in it matched the unlit empty room and read clear; only the lit empty template is `clear`
now. Device lane at the measured timings: 1000/1000 typical, 947/1000 all-maxima worst.

Open: a cohort; re-anchoring the origin on the observed 1 AM; a power reader; whether a shorter
contact is taken by the touch-up rules; the vibration channel (20 game vibrations, each at a light
press -- a candidate occupancy sensor, not yet tested); converting FNaF 2's grid/luma detectors
to native regions; the FNaF 1 teach overlay inside the Companion. Evidence ID:
`fnaf1-420-first-6am-20260925`.

**2026-09-25 (later): three more 4/20 nights, the teach panel in the Companion, and a recording
that kills.** `420-b` reached 6 AM again, narrated all night by the Companion's new FNaF 1 teach
panel (`fnaf1-custom-run.sh --teach`: the step and why, Bonnie/Chica/Foxy's clocks filling toward
their next tick, each door and its last light reading; English, the game's HUD face). The two
nights that also recorded the screen for a demonstration video died -- `420-c` to Chica at 75 s
(full-size screenrecord), `420-d` to Bonnie at ~226 s (1200x540, 2 Mbps) -- and the measurement
that explains both: any screenrecord halves the helper's distinct frames (75 -> 37 of 150 reads),
and the night's capture ran at ~10/s with ~2 s gaps. Under that starvation the door setter
touched a door again when a confirmation was late, undoing the first touch, and a monitor wait
held the finger through a tick. Fixed in the route: a door is touched again only if a frame
rendered 1.2 s after the touch still shows the old state (the panel names the new state the
frame the touch lands, 205-235 ms, measured on cal0); each monitor transition is bounded at 1.8 s;
a frame older than 400 ms answers no read. 4/20 stands at 2 of 4, 2 of 2 without a recording.
The README carries the FNaF 1 GIF (one Bonnie visit, `420-d` at 12 AM) beside FNaF 2's, which
Pedro asked to restore. Open: a Companion-side recorder that encodes the frames the helper
already has, so a video does not cost the night; the evidence pack adapter for FNaF 1 runs.
Evidence ID: `fnaf1-420-first-6am-20260925`.

**2026-09-25: the Plan 12 gate reads committed run packs; nineteen closed probes are archived.**
The gate read only `artifacts/`, which is per machine and gitignored, so a win could be promoted
only where it was played and only while its campaign directory survived. It did not survive for
the k3 cohort: its ten campaign directories and ten videos are no longer on the machine that played
them, while [`night7-cohort-k3-result-20260918`](../docs/evidence/night7-cohort-k3-result-20260918.json)
still cites them, and the vault has never exported anything (`docs/evidence/packs/` is empty).

`npm run evidence -- pack <night-run label | campaign id>` now writes a campaign's text evidence and
`night-run.sh`'s derived facts to `docs/evidence/runs/<run>/`, with the executor's `maskCells` grid
replaced by its hash, machine paths made portable, and every recording and frame listed as withheld
by sha256 only; it refuses anything pixel-shaped it was not told about
([`README`](../docs/evidence/README.md), `tools/evidence-pack.mjs`). `night-run.sh` packs every
campaign it runs. The seven live campaigns of 2026-09-20 still on this machine are packed: two 6 AMs
and five Night 6 deaths, 1.2 MB against ~2.6 GB withheld. On a checkout with no `artifacts/`,
`evidence -- promote` passes both wins on four of five checks and waits only for a person's
`plan12-attestation.json`; the Night 5 win's winner (`fnv1a-9ca64157`, `artifacts/toys-n5`) was never
committed and now is, as `tools/device/campaign-night5-toys-n5-winner.json`.

Separately, nineteen device probes and their eight tests whose questions are closed left the tree
([`ARCHIVED-ROUTES.md`](../docs/ARCHIVED-ROUTES.md), tag `archive/2026-09-24`).

Open: Pedro's attestations for the two packed wins; packing Night 5 `contact-final`, Night 6 `h` and
Night 7 `k2` on the peer machine, and `k3` wherever its campaigns still exist; the FNaF 1 runner,
which does not write campaign directories and so is not packed; the legacy `trial.sh` lane (Plan 22
P9). Evidence IDs: `night5-n5-armblock-20260920T004056Z`, `night6-n6h2-01-20260920T024030Z`.

**2026-09-25 (later): the legacy `trial.sh` lane is archived and every committed winner is held to
rebuilding.** Plan 22 P9. The open-loop shell runner, its driver parts, the mask-camp runners, the shell
preflight, the pilot supervisor, the screencap CAM 11 verifier with its game-crop fixtures, and the
three graders that read only that runner's artifacts left the tree (~9,600 lines;
[`ARCHIVED-ROUTES.md`](../docs/ARCHIVED-ROUTES.md)). `grade-run.sh` now reads what `night-run.sh` retains;
graded before and after on `night6-n6-bbfix-20260920T010859Z`, every live instrument printed the same
lines. `test-winners-rebuild.mjs` (in `test:unit`) compiles all eleven `winner-v1` files and puts each
through the campaign's bundle acceptance -- the chain `night-run.sh` drives, which no CI lane ran
before. It exposed that three winners compile to a normalised hash (`night1-minimal`, `night1-minus7`,
`night6`), which the run packs' `winnerCommitted` check now resolves.

Open: retiring the fixture service path (`DeviceControlService`, `composeDevice`, the runtime
scheduler and supervisor) that `npm run device:dry-run` and CI's dry-run lane exercise -- it plays no
nights, and `device:run` throws -- needs Pedro's decision because CLAUDE.md and `ci.yml` name it.
Evidence ID: `night6-n6-bbfix-20260920T010859Z` (the regrade).
