# Plan progress

**Updated:** 2026-08-26

**Overall:** **33%** — 29 of 88 mandatory top-level work packages are closed.

**Expanded stock-device roadmap (Plans 09–15):** **7%** — 3 of 44 mandatory
packages are closed.

## Very next step

**Verify the fork-free clock on hardware, then run the campaign ladder.**

The actuator lateness this pointed at on 2026-08-26 was decomposed, priced and
fixed in the same day, and the result changes what is reachable:

- `date +%s%3N` is a **fork+exec costing 21 ms** on the target phone, and
  `wait_until` busy-waited on it. Its landing error measured **49–106 ms**,
  which is the documented "49–93 ms macro anchor spread" — not a device floor.
- A builtin `read < /proc/uptime` costs **0.36 ms**. The same wait loop against
  it landed **0 ms late on 15/15 with a live night running**, where the shipped
  clock landed 34–73 ms late.
- The knee is a **frame count, not a millisecond figure**: uniform lateness is
  free to 41 ms (200/200 every night) and gone at 42 ms. Quote frames.
- Priced through `actuator.mjs`, moving from the shipped 49–106 ms band to
  0–10 ms takes Nights 1–5 to **200/200** and Night 6 to **171/200**, in the
  simulator. Night 7 goes 0 → 25/200 and is still blocked by the one-frame
  phase island, which is a route problem rather than a clock one.

The runner's clock has landed on `/proc/uptime`. **It has not been verified on
the phone** — the 0-of-15 figure came from a bare shell loop, not from the real
cycle with `hid_mark`, HID writes and the classifier in it.

**This step is complete when** the runner's per-anchor landing error is measured
on hardware inside a real cycle and holds under the two-frame budget, the
`/proc/uptime`↔epoch offset is checked for drift across a night, and a campaign
night is then attempted and graded end to end. Nights 1–5 are the target; Night
7 is explicitly not, and needs a route whose sweep tolerates a frame.

## Dashboard

| Plan | Closed / mandatory packages | Progress | Current state | Next gate |
|---|---:|---:|---|---|
| [01 — research pass](01-research-pass.md) | 3 / 3 | **100%** | Done | None |
| [02 — Minus 3 mode](02-minus-3-mode.md) | 1 / 6 | **17%** | Research/simulator verdict complete; framing decision blocks implementation | Decide best-odds practice, PC history, or close the mode |
| [03 — right-vent-camp mode](03-right-vent-camp-mode.md) | 1 / 5 | **20%** | Engine sourcing complete (2026-08-24); reactive coach, decision table, ladder and grading untouched | Design the reactive coach: situation detection, expected response, reaction window, decision grading |
| [04 — optimize Minus 7](04-optimize-minus-7.md) | 3 / 4 | **75%** | Search and grading work complete | Replace inferred human profile with accumulated trainer traces |
| [05 — derive new strategy](05-derive-new-strategy.md) | 5 / 5 | **100%** | Closed by sourced refutation/negative result | Reopen only after a source-rule change |
| [06 — hybrid search](06-hybrid-strategy-search.md) | 6 / 6 | **100%** | Closed with no survivor | Reopen only after a corrected mechanic changes reachable policy space |
| [07 — tooling consolidation](07-tooling-consolidation.md) | 5 / 8 | **63%** | Correctness pass complete; opportunistic refactors remain | Extract shared browser session during the next browser-tool change |
| [08 — audio-cue controller](08-audio-cue-controller.md) | 2 / 7 | **29%** | Source map and playback capture pass; detector/latency/shadow gates remain | Session-split bang holdout and confusion matrix |
| [09 — observation corpus](09-observation-corpus.md) | 1 / 6 | **17%** | Schemas, validator and producers all landed; every runner emits a manifest on every exit path, proven against mock adb only | Validate one real captured session; the next hardware run closes package 2 |
| [10 — stock-device controller](10-stock-device-controller.md) | 0 / 7 | **0%** | Package 0 advanced: pan sourced and measured, both lights verified, office proven 1600×768 and the screen mapping derived; the right vent's scene X stays unknown | Price the right vent's ~570 ms pan round trip, then close the vocabulary |
| [11 — policy interface](11-policy-interface-and-baselines.md) | 0 / 5 | **0%** | Proposed; optional Gym package excluded from denominator | Freeze exact-engine policy protocol after Plan 09 record agreement |
| [12 — evidence campaign](12-end-to-end-evidence-campaign.md) | 0 / 7 | **0%** | Lateness decomposed and priced: the knee is the 2→3 frame boundary, and the fork-free clock recovers Nights 1–5 in the simulator; Night 7 stays blocked by the phase island | Gate A after Plans 09–11 provide their contracts |
| [13 — campaign/all-night](13-campaign-and-all-night-support.md) | 2 / 8 | **25%** | Nights 1–6 build, replay and gate; title observed; a real death now classifies night→static→gameover→title with no unknown | Capture a 6 AM and the minigames; both still report unknown |
| [14 — device portability](14-device-portability-and-profiles.md) | 0 / 6 | **0%** | Proposed; the canvas→screen mapping is now derived (stretch-to-fill, predicted 1720 against a measured 1700–1800) rather than calibrated | Inventory and classify the coupling: geometry, layout mode, pixel models, timing |
| [15 — sensor independence](15-sensor-independent-observations.md) | 0 / 5 | **0%** | Proposed; every classifier is bound to one capture method and the cue helper's fast read is blocked on a `screencap` threshold | Inventory every fact × sensor pairing as calibrated, assumed, or absent |

## Counting rule

- The denominator is the mandatory numbered work packages in each plan. Plan
  11's explicitly optional Gymnasium package is excluded.
- Plan 13 adds eight mandatory packages; the completion numerator remains
  unchanged until one of its gates actually closes.
- Plan 14 adds six mandatory packages on 2026-08-26 (77 -> 83 mandatory). Its
  package 6 needs a second handset the project does not have; it is counted
  because the plan's done criteria cannot close without it, unlike Plan 11's
  Gymnasium package which is optional to its own goal.
- Plan 15 adds five mandatory packages on 2026-08-26 (83 -> 88 mandatory). It
  exists because the same game fact is currently re-taught per capture method,
  and three more sensor-bound classifiers were added the same day.
- Plan 10 gained a package 0 on 2026-08-26 (76 -> 77 mandatory): the basic
  interaction vocabulary the schedule is made of was never established, and
  office panning appears in the record only as a failure mode.
- A package contributes only when its plan marks it closed, completed, passed,
  or closed by a documented negative result. Partial or “advanced” work receives
  no fractional credit.
- Plans 05 and 06 count as complete because their done criteria explicitly
  accept a recorded refutation/no-survivor result; implementation was correctly
  not started after the candidate failed.
- Prerequisite research outside a plan's numbered implementation packages is
  described in the state column but does not inflate its percentage.
- Adding, removing, reopening, or closing a mandatory package changes the
  numerator or denominator here in the same commit.
- A row is read off its plan's own completion markers, never from memory. This
  file was written on 2026-08-26, after several plans had already closed
  packages, and a same-day audit found Plan 03's row had been authored stale:
  its work item 1 closed on 2026-08-24 and the row still said `0 / 5` and named
  that finished work as the next gate. The audit also found Plan 08's "Done
  when" section still carrying a withdrawn refutation that, read literally,
  closed five packages the plan's own table lists as open.

This percentage measures completion of the written plans, not probability of a
clear. In particular, simulator success, a bounded device branch, a Night 6
attempt, a Night 6 clear, and a 10/20 clear remain distinct claims under
[Plan 12](12-end-to-end-evidence-campaign.md).
