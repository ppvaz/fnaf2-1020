# Ablation runs: which observations and controls are actually load-bearing

*Research note: 2026-09-19. Public challenge runs, checked against our own
source dumps. Nothing here was run on this project's handset.*

Companion to [`FNAF4-AUDIO-INDEPENDENCE.md`](FNAF4-AUDIO-INDEPENDENCE.md),
which covers the same author's FNaF 4 no-audio clear.

## Why this matters here

Every expansion target in [Plan 26](../../plans/26-second-target-fnaf-1-3-4.md)
carries a device-layer cost proportional to **how many observation channels the
route needs**. A route that must read a door light, a camera feed and an audio
cue needs three calibrated detectors; a route that needs one needs one.

These runs are natural ablation experiments: a competent player removes one
designed channel and reports whether the game is still winnable. Each success
is evidence that a channel is *not* load-bearing, and therefore that our
control map and belief gate for that game can be smaller than its UI suggests.

## The runs

All by Chickeninja42, the same author as the FNaF 4 no-audio clear.

| Run | Removed | Video | Date | Length |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| FNaF 1, no lights | the door-light observation | [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ewEFDl1jpfI) | 2023-03-05 | 27 min |
| FNaF 3, no maintenance | *all* error recovery (audio, camera, ventilation) | [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQjzXft6L0k) | 2023-04-09 | 28 min |
| FNaF 3, no cameras | the camera system | [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6qGaxY_p9s) | 2024-11-10 | 63 min |

**All three succeed.** Together with the FNaF 4 result, every FNaF night game
this project might target has been cleared with one of its designed channels
removed.

## FNaF 1 — the door light is not required

`[C]` The lights are the only way to see an animatronic at your door: the two
office-adjacent cameras have a blind spot. The no-lights run substitutes
**continuous camera tracking** — knowing where everyone is at all times — and
pays for it in power.

### Verified against our dump

`SOURCE` The power model checks out arithmetically, which is a strong
independent confirmation of the reading in Plan 26. `power left` starts at 999
and drains `usage meter` per second, where `usage = 1 + Σ(control room follow
0..4)` (groups 313–315). A FNaF 1 night is 8:55 = 535 s over 6 hours, i.e.
~89 s per in-game hour. So:

| Controls active | `usage` | Units/hour | % of 999 | Author's figure |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| camera only | 2 | 178 | 17.8% | 18/hour |
| camera + 1 door | 3 | 267 | 26.7% | 27/hour |
| camera + 2 doors | 4 | 356 | 35.6% | 36/hour |

The community's per-hour percentages fall directly out of the dumped constants.

`SOURCE` The power-outage sequence is confirmed. **Group 406** — `Every 5000 ms`
+ `Random(5)+1 = 1` (a 20% roll) while `power down = 1` — matches the described
"every five seconds, 20% chance" first stage exactly.

`SOURCE` A door-camper really does drain power indefinitely: the door position
is an ordinary position in the movement pipeline, so repeated failed rolls
simply leave the animatronic there. The author reports a 3-minute camp
(~36 consecutive failed rolls), which is consistent with the 4970/4980 ms roll
cadence already extracted.

### Claimed, not yet verified

- `[C]` Foxy freezes while his camera is being viewed, and after the camera
  closes has a random cooldown of **0.83–16.67 s** (which would be 50–1000
  frames at 60 fps — a suspiciously clean `Random(950)+50` shape).
  `UNKNOWN(not-located)`: no such constant was found in the office frame.
- `[C]` At stage 4 Foxy attacks either on a West Hall camera check or after
  25 s; a door-blocked attack costs 1, then 6, then 11 power.
- `[C]` Bonnie can jump from the Supply Closet **directly** to the door,
  skipping the corner; a blocked Bonnie always returns to the dining area,
  while a blocked Chica may return to the hallway instead.

These four would materially shape a FNaF 1 route and should be traced before
any of them is encoded.

## FNaF 3 — both the cameras and the whole repair panel are droppable

`[C]` The no-maintenance run never opens the maintenance panel, so any audio,
camera or ventilation error persists for the rest of the night. The no-cameras
run drops the camera system entirely. Both clear the game.

### The aggression term, explained and then corrected

Plan 26 extracted Springtrap's rule from the dump but could not interpret one
term:

```
move counter > ((10 - AI - aggresive?) + Random(15) - total turns)
```

`[C]` The author explains `aggresive?` as an "aggressive factor" that flips
from 0 to 1 on a phantom jumpscare, a ventilation error, sitting inactive in
the office for 10 s, or the clock passing 4 AM.

`SOURCE` Our dump confirms all four **and adds two more**:

| Group | Condition | Sets `aggresive?` |
|---|---|---|
| 391 | `ventilation text AV0 <= -10` (ventilation error) | 1 |
| 662 | phantom jumpscare **and** `Random(5) < AI` | 1 |
| 753 | `frozen = 1` | 1 |
| 754 | `scroll AV15 > 0` | 1 |
| 904 | `time of night >= 4` (4 AM) | 1 |
| 909 | `ventilation text AV6 > 10` (office inactivity) | 1 |
| **220** | **`Every 15000 ms`** | **0** |

Two corrections follow, and both matter for a route:

1. **The aggression flag decays.** Group 220 resets it to 0 on a 15 s timer.
   The public description treats it as a latch. It is not one — it is a flag
   that must be *continuously* re-triggered to stay set.
2. **The phantom path is AI-gated.** A phantom jumpscare only raises aggression
   when `Random(5) < AI`, so on low-AI nights phantoms often cost nothing.

`SOURCE` Also note `Random(15)` in Clickteam yields **0–14**, not the 1–15 the
video assumes. The dump is authoritative.

### One error model, three systems

`SOURCE` Audio, camera and ventilation are not three mechanics but one, three
times over: each has a `* text` object whose AV0 decays, and each raises its
error at the **same `<= -10` threshold** (groups ~2592–2619). Ventilation
additionally drives `ventilation error 2` and the aggression flag.

That is convenient for us: a single scalar-threshold detector generalises
across all three systems rather than needing three bespoke rules.

`[C]` Phantom effects map to specific errors — Mangle causes the *audio* error
while Balloon Boy, Chica, Foxy and Freddy cause *ventilation* errors. Not yet
traced.

`[C]` A FNaF 3 night is 348 s.

`SOURCE` **The vent and camera namespace is one numbering, traced 2026-09-19.**
Locations 1–10 are the cameras and 11–15 are `vent 11`–`vent 15`. `you in` holds
1–15 and is set by the camera-selection handlers, so it is **the camera the
player is viewing**, not Springtrap's position — an earlier draft of this note
had that backwards. Springtrap's own location is the `dhfgh` object's position.
Sealing writes the chosen vent through `going to seal` (which holds 11–15 and
has **no decrement anywhere** — a selector register, not a timer) into
`what vent is closed`.

`SOURCE` **`mon in` is Springtrap's location**, mirrored into a counter by one
group per camera ("if he overlaps cam N, set it to N"). So `you in = mon in` is
the test for *the player is watching the camera he is in*, and `you in <> mon in`
its negation. An earlier draft of this note had the right test with the wrong
entity on one side; both are now measured.

`SOURCE` **The vent topology, traced from Springtrap's 73 movement edges.**
Each vent is entered from exactly one camera, on branch `action selected = 4`,
and exits either back to that camera or onward:

| Vent | Entered from | Returns to | Or advances to |
|---|---|---|---|
| 11 | cam 09 | cam 09 | attack stage 3 |
| 12 | cam 07 | cam 07 | attack stage 3 |
| 13 | cam 05 | cam 05 | attack stage 1 |
| 14 | cam 10 | cam 10 | **GOT YOU 2** |
| 15 | cam 02 | cam 02 | **GOT YOU 2** |

The attack chain runs stage 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → GOT YOU, so **the vents are not
equally dangerous**: 14 and 15 bypass the chain entirely and kill outright,
11 and 12 enter two steps from the end, and 13 enters with the full chain left.
A sealing priority follows directly — 14 and 15 first, then 11 and 12, then 13.
No public account of this game states that asymmetry.

`SOURCE` **The 19 edges left unattributed above are now traced, and they are
four mechanisms rather than one** — an earlier draft guessed "most likely the
audio-lure teleports", which was too hasty:

- **Night-start spawn.** At frame start Springtrap draws `Random(5)+1`, which
  places him at cam 10, 09, 08, 07 or 06 respectively, then marks himself
  placed. Uniform over five starting cameras, and it is the **first RNG draw of
  the night**. Because the RNG model transfers (see Plan 26), his starting
  camera is therefore predictable per seed.
- **Audio lure.** A lure object is placed at a camera; when Springtrap is in an
  adjacent room it is consumed, the target camera is stored on him, and a
  per-lure delay is drawn as `Random(100)`. On relocation his **`move counter`
  is reset to 0**. So a lure does not merely reposition him — it buys a full
  movement-timer reset. No public account of this game states that; they
  describe lures purely as repositioning.
- **Scripted forced move**, keyed on a `force move` / `force to` pair, to three
  fixed cameras.
- **Attack escalation** to attack stage 2 while a screen is being viewed.

## What this changes for Plan 26

1. **The per-game sensing requirement is smaller than each game's UI implies.**
   FNaF 1 without door lights, FNaF 3 without cameras *or* repairs, FNaF 4
   without audio. No target needs its full designed observation set.
2. **FNaF 1's cost moves from sensing to power.** Dropping the light
   observation is free for us — we would rather read cameras anyway — but it
   raises `usage` to 2 continuously. A FNaF 1 route is a power-budget problem,
   which is a *scheduling* problem, and scheduling is this project's strength.
3. **FNaF 3 gets cheaper again.** If the maintenance panel is droppable, the
   control surface shrinks to audio lure, vent seal and camera flip — and the
   aggression decay at 15 s gives a route an exploitable rhythm rather than a
   one-way ratchet.
4. **Ablation is a cheap experiment design we should borrow.** Removing one
   channel and re-running is exactly how to find the minimal observation set
   for a machine route, and it costs nothing but device time.

## Provenance

Transcripts were retrieved with `yt-dlp` auto-captions and read for claims
only; nothing from them is reproduced here. Every `SOURCE` line was read out of
our own event dumps (`~/fnaf-apks/fnaf1/events/`, `~/fnaf-apks/fnaf3/events/`,
dumped 2026-09-19 at the handle constants recorded in Plan 26). Where the two
disagree — the aggression latch, the `Random(15)` range — the dump wins.
