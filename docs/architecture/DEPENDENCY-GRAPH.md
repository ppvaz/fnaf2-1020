Core has no application, adapter, shell, DOM, process, network, filesystem, or
wall-clock dependency. Adapters implement ports and report measured
limitations. Device profile resolution is immutable and retained in each run.
The root `src` compatibility imports have been removed after the equivalence
gate. Explicitly named legacy device and screencheck facades remain only for
characterization and are not package dependencies.
