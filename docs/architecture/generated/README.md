# Generated architecture catalogs

Run `npm run catalog` to regenerate these checked-in inventories from package
manifests, source paths, the contract register, and the command surface. They
are migration maps, not a second manually edited authority. Review generated
diffs with their source changes. Contract specifications are generated for every
register entry and include purpose, non-purpose, clock/unit, unknown/error,
compatibility, runtime-validator, and fixture fields.
Catalog generation fails when a registered contract has no conformance fixture
or when a listed fixture path is absent, so a green catalog cannot silently
fall back to a generic test.

`reverse-links.json` is the generated reverse view for stable contract, ADR,
claim, and evidence references, including contract-to-fixture links. Run
`npm run test:retrieval` to execute the newcomer retrieval benchmark; it guards
the top-level routes without introducing a separately edited wiki or mandatory
search service.

`legacy-paths.json` is the generated compatibility/removal map. Each entry
names the lifecycle, canonical replacement owner, and evidence gate required
before a path can be deleted. It is intentionally generated from the registry
in `tools/generate-catalog.js`, not edited independently.
