/**
 * Where the teach panel may paint, and with which colours.
 *
 * <p>The panel is its own window, exactly this rectangle, so WindowManager
 * clips every pixel it draws to it. The rectangle is the largest strip on the
 * left of the office that no reader of the frame samples: it sits between the
 * helper's 20x9 grid rows at y = 300 and y = 420 and left of the CAM 05 block
 * (x >= 600), and clear of the host night predicate's rows, the lifecycle
 * boxes, and the video grader's clock band (y >= 432) and mask bar. Those
 * claims are tests, not comments: TeachPanelTest drives every helper reader
 * over a recording frame, and tools/device/test-teach-panel-clearance.py
 * checks the host readers. The rectangle itself is declared once, in
 * tools/device/models/teach-panel-v1.json, and both tests read it.</p>
 *
 * <p>The palette is chosen against the video grader's selected-camera rule
 * (r > 150 and g > 150 and b < 110 anywhere in the frame): no ink, and no
 * antialiased blend of an ink over the opaque fill, can satisfy it. The
 * trainer's amber light colour does, so the panel's light ink is paler. That
 * covers what the panel paints, not what shows through it: the platform caps
 * the window at 0.8 opacity (measured on the g56), so a teach video is graded
 * with this rectangle blanked (run-timeline.py --exclude-rect).</p>
 *
 * <p>Pure Java: no Android types, so android/companion/test.sh runs it on the
 * host.</p>
