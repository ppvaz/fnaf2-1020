# Working notes for this repository

This project is mostly an **evidence argument**, not a codebase. Most of the
cost here is not writing code — it is drawing a conclusion the repository had
already answered, and then building on it. Every item below exists because that
happened, and the fix is always the same: read the page that already knows.

**Commit on `master`.** This repository does not use branches — overriding the
global agreement's "if on the default branch, branch first".

**`Night 6` is the game's night; `night 6-34` is the 34th device run on it.**
The runs are named `n6-night-34` on disk, and writing them as "night 34" reads
as a night the game does not have.

## Read these before concluding, not after

| Before you claim… | Read |
|---|---|
| a cue is ambiguous, or an animatronic could be responsible | [`docs/strategy/MINUS-7-STRATEGY.md`](docs/strategy/MINUS-7-STRATEGY.md) §"Who is *not* stalled" |
| anything about a device run's configuration or its failure | [`docs/device/HID-MULTITOUCH.md`](docs/device/HID-MULTITOUCH.md) |
| an observation is cheap enough to add to the pilot loop | [`docs/device/ON-DEVICE-VALIDATION.md`](docs/device/ON-DEVICE-VALIDATION.md) |
| anything citing a group number | [`docs/android/SOURCE-DUMP-GUIDE.md`](docs/android/SOURCE-DUMP-GUIDE.md) §4 |

The event sheet describes the **game**. The strategy describes the **run**. A
sample shared by seven characters is not ambiguous if this line stun-locks all
seven — that single distinction invalidated a day of conclusions on 2026-08-24,
including a withdrawn strategy rule and a retraction written into the strategy
document contradicting how the line is actually played.

## Device runs

- **A run with no Balloon Boy read is a known-dead configuration.**
  `HID-MULTITOUCH.md` records **0/3000** Night 6 for it in the exact simulator,
  through the BB→Foxy chain. A run without it has not tested anything.
- **CAM 05 is not the Night 6 checkpoint.** The device-validated classifier is
  the **lit left opening**, and its light costs no flashlight battery.
- **Price every observation before scheduling it.** The cycle has roughly
  **680 ms free**. A `screencap` costs **225 ms**; the cue helper's device-local
  read costs **59 ms** and now covers both the left opening and the CAM 05
  region from the same 20×9 frame. Adding a screencap every four cycles was
  enough to truncate the wind and collapse the box from 52% to 10%.
- **Price a policy against `--device-sweep`, not the ideal actuator.** The
  published 10000/10000 Night 6 figure uses a 267 ms three-camera sweep, and a
  held 790 ms lit sweep alone outspends the whole 3000-frame night-6 flashlight.
  See `HID-MULTITOUCH.md` §"The Night 6 route, priced against the phone's
  actuator".

  **This bullet said "at the proven 240 ms spacing the same route is 0/1000"
  until 2026-08-26, and that was stale by two days.** `HID-MULTITOUCH.md`
  §"Answered: the phone accepts 120 ms spacing (2026-08-24)" **withdrew** the
  240 ms figure as a *measurement artifact*: `camtrace.py` decoded at 30 fps and
  required a 100 ms stable run, so at 160 ms spacing every dwell reported as
  exactly the 0.10 s floor and read as a dropped selection. Re-graded at the
  recording's native 60 fps, the same three probe runs are **4/4 at 240, 160 and
  120 ms**. Nothing about the input changed.

  The consequence is not cosmetic. That page's own table prices the phase window
  by spacing — 240 ms → 2 frames ("not landable"), 160 ms → 6, **120 ms → 12
  frames (200 ms), against a `DEVICE_EPOCH_LATCH` bracket of about 80 ms**. So
  the blocker it names as "singular" — the camera actuator's inter-selection
  spacing — **was answered, in the phone's favour**. `DEVICE_SPACING_MS` is 120
  in `recipe.mjs` and `test-recipe.mjs` gates against it; only this file still
  said 240. An independent 2026-08-26 literature survey reached the same place
  from the other side: nothing in Android, evdev, uinput or InputDispatcher
  imposes any such floor (§"Input injection and sequential budgets"). Do not
  quote 240 ms as a device limit again.
- **The controller route runs nothing the model gate has not passed — absolute,
  no override (2026-08-25).** Before its first adb command, `trial.sh`
  replays the emitted plan through the exact engine under measured human slack
  (±60 ms iid, the floor of the plans/04 bracket, until the trace census in
  `tools/tracereport.mjs` supersedes it with correlated bands) and refuses
  below the 40% replay contract (`tools/device/human-gate.mjs`). A mode whose
  schedule is inline and unpriceable is refused outright, not backstopped —
  port the table to `recipe.mjs --device-plan` to run it. A gap floor is the
  wrong model of "inhuman" (Minus 7 lands a 70 ms chord; the machine route's
  120 ms gaps need a one-frame phase island): precision separates human from
  machine, so the gate asks the engine, not a ruler.

  **Scoped 2026-08-26, because the unscoped sentence was false** and it is the
  claim that authorizes the Plan 12 ladder — a claim that is false in prose is
  worse than one that is merely narrow (`ARCHITECTURE-AUDIT.md` finding 8).
  What the gate actually covers, and what it does not:

  - **Covered:** every *scheduled* press of the sole controller route. The
    ~370 lines of inline `press_at` literals that used to sit unreachable in
    `trial.sh` are deleted, and `test-runner-plan.mjs` now scans the
    **whole** driver rather than a slice that ended exactly where they began.
  - **Not covered, legitimately, and now named rather than glossed:** the
    runtime *reactive* presses — `monitor-verify`, `monitor-resync`,
    `monitor-resync-2`, and the opening `mute`. These are not in the plan, so
    no plan gate can price them. On the gated route the live `HUMAN_FLOOR_MS`
    check no longer prices them either: it stands down when `NIGHT6_LEFT=1`,
    because its 350 ms scalar aborted the accepted plan at its own deliberate
    120/180 ms compound boundaries (a real device run died exactly this way —
    `RUN-TELEMETRY.md` §10). **So reactive presses are currently priced by
    nothing.** They inherit `MONITOR_ANIM_DOWN` (367 ms) of forced wait, which
    happens to clear the old floor, but that is a coincidence of the corrector's
    design and not a check.
  - **Not covered, and unresolved:** `trial-maskcamp.sh` is a second device
    runner that presses via `adb shell input swipe` from a hand-written inline
    schedule, with no gate and no floor. It is a mask-camp *experiment* harness
    rather than a policy pilot, and `run-batch.sh` plus four documents depend on
    it, so it has not been retired on one session's judgement. Decide: gate it,
    port its table, or retire it.

  The live `HUMAN_FLOOR_MS` check in `press_at` remains only as the backstop for
  dormant unpriced branches (`NIGHT6_LEFT=0`). Both arms are pinned by
  `test-plan-interpreter.sh` — the bypass originally shipped with neither.
  **Corrected twice on 2026-08-26; both halves are the lesson.** First: the
  shipped Night 6 plan did NOT pass. It had been quoted as "46/100 under human
  slack" from 2026-08-25, but that was seeds 1..100, and 100 draws cannot
  measure a rate near the bar (binomial SE 4.8 points). Over 1200 seeds it was
  **449/1200 = 37.4%** against the 40% contract, with only five of twelve
  100-seed blocks clearing it. `GATE_RUNS` is now 1200 (4.7 s), and the gate
  correctly refused the route.
  Second, later the same day: the refusal was fixed **at its cause, not by
  moving the bar**. The clear branch had lost its first Foxy reset — a
  standalone hall slot that landed inside mask-off and did nothing at the
  measured read latency — so it now rides the existing post-read `maskraise`
  row. The read, the sweep and the measured 180 ms mask→monitor seam did not
  move. On the same 1200 seeds **all six nights now pass**: 99.1, 68.9, 78.8,
  73.2, 63.9 and 56.1 per cent, so the ladder is gate-clean to Night 6 and
  `test-human-gate.mjs` pins the acceptance (673/1200) rather than a refusal.
  **The margin was paid for in flashlight:** light spend rose 2148 → 2808
  frames, and Nights 5-6 have only **192 frames of headroom left** (~3.2 s)
  against a 3000-frame budget. Price any new lit observation against that.

  **Re-measured 2026-08-26** after the per-night music-box drain was sourced
  (`src/config.js`, groups g653-660): **99.4, 68.4, 79.3, 73.9, 63.8, 56.0**.
  The engine had been draining every night at the night-6/7 rate from t=0, so
  Nights 1-5 were priced against a box that emptied 2-3x too fast — and Night 1
  against one that drained two hours before the game starts it. Correcting that
  moved the ladder **by less than a point on every night**.

  That non-result is the useful part, and it refuted the expectation that wrote
  it: **the box was never the binding constraint below Night 6.** The gate's
  own death causes say so — the Puppet takes 7-15 runs in 1200 on every night,
  while Foxy and office entries take ~95% of all losses (Night 6: 338 foxy,
  175 inside-office, 15 puppet). So do not record the re-sourcing as a survival
  improvement. It is a correctness fix with a survival effect of roughly zero,
  and it means **wind budget is not where the remaining nights are won** —
  spend effort on the Foxy reset and the office-entry mask instead.
- **A plan names its night, and nothing downstream guesses one.**
  `recipe.mjs --device-plan` emits a `#night N` header; `replay()` requires
  `night` and `human-gate.mjs` refuses a plan that does not name one. The old
  `night = 6` defaults would have priced a Night 3 plan against Night 6's AI
  table. Whether a threat branch is *reachable* comes from the sourced AI table
  (`C.canAct`), never from whether one sampled seed happened to show it — Night
  1 cannot arm Balloon Boy at all, Night 3 merely makes him rare, and one
  `throw` used to conflate those. See `tools/device/test-night-matrix.mjs`.
- **Short taps get dropped** — Fusion polls touch per frame. The device runner
  now has one gated `hid-multi` route; its plan holds every bare contact for at
  least 100 ms. `fast-swipe` survives only in the historical run record and
  the staged `pilottest.mjs` research model, not as a selectable device mode.
- **A legal input stream is not an accepted one.** `test-hid-trace.mjs` audits
  what the phone was *sent*; only `desync-scan.py` says what the game *did*.
  Presses that pass the auditor's 20 ms floor were still dropped: a monitor
  press within 180 ms of a mask press is lost about half the time, because the
  monitor bar is not drawn while the mask is up. 9 of 14 catalogued desyncs are
  that one seam. See `ON-DEVICE-VALIDATION.md` §"Which press desyncs, and why".
- **Unexpected office pan during a run means desync — and it is the cheapest
  tell there is (2026-08-26).** Measured on the cleared Night 1: 16 of 16
  `empty` vent reads sit at 0–6 px of office pan; 6 of 7 *false* `inside` reads
  sit at **64–178 px**. The classifier's margin tracks pan monotonically (0 px →
  19, 6 px → 20, displaced → 18, which is the `inside` boundary), so on a
  panned frame **the left-opening classifier is reading camera position, not an
  animatronic**. That run desynced roughly eight times and the runner noticed
  **once**, and its single `monitor-resync` did not work — the next read, five
  seconds later, still photographed the Main Hall camera feed. A panned office
  also means every press in that cycle lands on coordinates calibrated for an
  unpanned one. Before adopting pan as a detector, price it: it is a full-frame
  correlation and the cycle has ~680 ms free. See
  `ON-DEVICE-SCREEN-CHECKS.md` §"The left-opening classifier measures camera pan".
- **A HUD-absent stretch is the monitor, not a death.** `grade-night.py` ended
  the run at the first one and graded a **418 s winning night at 6.5 s** — the
  controller lives on the monitor, 3.5 s of every 5 s cycle. Only the death
  *static* ends a run now; `dark screen` is ambiguous (a dark camera, a raised
  mask and a death minigame all read the same) and is reported as such rather
  than decided. **A 6 AM still looks exactly like a death to every instrument
  here**, so a won night's manifest reads `lifecycle=unknown` until plan 13
  package 3 lands.
- **One lost monitor press inverts the rest of the night**, and nothing in the
  run notices: the vent read photographs the camera feed, the hall press pans
  the map, the box stops being wound, and the log still reads like a schedule.
  Never observe the monitor inside `MONITOR_ANIM_DOWN` (367 ms) of a monitor
  press — night 6-38's "correction" was a false positive taken 247 ms in, and it
  caused the desync it was looking for.
- `dumpsys window` prints several `mCurrentFocus` lines and the first is often
  `null` mid-transition. Match the package across all of them, never `-m1`.
- **`cmd | tr ... | grep -q` is a broken guard under `set -o pipefail`.** `grep -q`
  exits on the first match, `tr` dies of SIGPIPE, and the pipeline reports 141 --
  so the `if` reads false precisely when the pattern *did* match. It skipped the
  Bluetooth-audio guard twice and let two nights record silence. Measured: only
  a raw streaming filter is affected -- `adb | grep -q` and `adb | grep | grep -q`
  are fine, because `grep` handles SIGPIPE and exits cleanly. Use a herestring
  (`grep -q PAT <<<"$captured"`), and don't "fix" the pipelines that are fine.

## Every camera flash must land, and today ~3% do not (2026-08-26)

**This is the mission blocker, not an elegance detail.** Measured by
`sweepcheck.py` on the cleared `n1-grey-2202`: **68/75 sweeps flashed all of
10,4,7**. Per flash that is 218/225 = 96.9%; CAM 07 alone is 70/75 = 93.3%,
because it is **last** in the 10 -> 4 -> 7 order and takes five of the seven
misses. CAM 04 never missed.

There is no margin for a single miss. `STUN_FRAMES` is 400 (6.67 s) against a
5 s cycle, so a landed flash covers the *next* sweep with 1.67 s to spare -- but
if that one misses, the stun expires 1.67 s later and the sweep after it is
3.33 s too late. A movement window opens on **one** miss. That is how Toy Chica
reached the office hallway at 5 AM on a night where none of the five CAM 07
misses were consecutive, while Toy Bonnie -- sitting on CAM 04, which never
missed -- stayed pinned all night.

Compounded, essentially every night leaks: P(all 225 flashes land) at 96.9% is
**0.08%**, and P(CAM 07 never missed) is **0.55%**. Night 7 has all eleven at
maximum AI and nothing to absorb a gap, so **a 97% actuator cannot clear it**
however good the schedule is.

It also prices the simulator's headline. A 10000/10000 figure is computed
against an actuator that never drops a flash. The device drops one flash in
thirty-two.

The mechanism is not yet established -- the suspect is a dropped *selection*
(one contact of 100 ms at 120 ms spacing leaves 20 ms released against a
~16.7 ms Fusion poll), and the control that separates "never sent" from "sent
and swallowed" is the HID trace, which that run did not record. **Set
`HID_TRACE_RUN=1` on every further night until this is closed.** See
`ON-DEVICE-VALIDATION.md` §"The last flash: a mechanism, and the control that
is missing".

## The simulator prices nothing

`pilottest`/`hidpilottest` count frames. A press and a screencap both look free,
so **any survival figure is a statement about the model**, not the device. Do
not promote a policy on simulator survival alone, and say "in the simulator"
when quoting one.

`--device-actuator` narrows that gap without closing it: it prices a run
through the measured phone (launch lateness, the mask-seam monitor drop —
`tools/device/actuator.mjs`). Under it the shipped n6 target goes 500/500 →
0/200, dying to the forcedown parity cascade — which is a statement about
these pilots' *open-loop* monitor model: the live runner's checkpoint read
and verified recovery are not modeled. Survival under the actuator is still
survival in a model.

## Numbers need their control

A favourable number is not a result until something that *should not* produce it
has been checked. A detector reporting 22 thuds across 285 s of night audio was
reported as working, and reasoned about at length, before a waveform
cross-correlation showed **all 22 were false positives**. The controls that
would have caught it were cheap: a recording that cannot contain the cue, and a
second signature that fails differently.

## A run length is a graded interval, not wall clock

`tools/device/grade-run.sh RUN_NAME` runs every instrument this repository owns
against one run and prints one verdict. Run it before quoting any number off a
device run, and quote the interval it reports.

The reason is a worked example. Nights 6-36 and 6-37 were reported at **163 s** and
**153 s**, "past 2 AM", a new record. Graded, they were **26.0 s** and **72.2 s**
alive. The rest was the pilot pressing into a dead game: the retained classifier
frames show the death static, the "Take cake to the children" minigame, and a
"12:00 AM 6th Night" restart card. Two independent failures produced that:

- The watchdog's fast path recognised exactly one way of being dead (a bright,
  silent static screen) and answered "night" to everything else. A detector that
  knows one way to be dead must never be what says you are alive. It may only
  *add* a detection; `screenstate.py` stays the authority.
- `GRADE_RUN=1` graded `"$OUT.mp4"`, and every run ending in an abort saves
  `"$OUT-aborted.mp4"`. So the grading step ran against a file that did not
  exist, printed nothing, and looked exactly like grading in the log.

**A pipeline that silently grades nothing is worse than no pipeline**, because
it reads as coverage. If a step cannot find its input, it must say so and fail.

## Instruments are not a pipeline

This repository is full of instruments -- `camtrace.py`, `sweepcheck.py`,
`windpct.py`, `grade-minus7.py`, `screenstate.py`, `grade-night.py`,
`test-hid-trace.mjs`, `replay-screen-model.py` -- and the failure mode is never
that one is missing. It is that each has to be *remembered*, and what is not
remembered is not run. `screenstate.py` could have refuted the 163 s claim from
any single frame of that recording; nobody invoked it.

So: do not add an instrument without adding it to `grade-run.sh`. An instrument
nobody runs is a comment. This is now enforced: `test-grade-run-coverage.mjs`
fails the engine suite on any `tools/device` script that is neither invoked by
`grade-run.sh` nor consciously excluded, with a reason, in its exclusion list.

## Who this is for: agents, humans, and humans working with agents

Today the main developer and consumer of this project is an LLM agent picking
the work up cold, reading what the last session left behind, and reconstructing
what happened. That will not necessarily always be true. **The project must be
ergonomic for all three audiences at once**, and where they pull in different
directions the resolution is usually the same:

- **Prefer rich, self-describing records over narrow schemas.** Every expensive
  surprise here was a question nobody had thought to ask -- a cutscene reading
  as a night, a music box draining 3.3x slower than its constant, a gate passing
  on its seed block. A format that captures only the anticipated fields would
  have missed all three. Latitude in shape; none in honesty.
- **Say which clock, which sensor, which night, which build.** A number an agent
  cannot place is a number it must re-measure. This is why `UNKNOWN(reason)` is
  worth more than a plausible value: an agent can reason about the first and is
  actively misled by the second.
- **Write the why, not just the what.** Most of this file exists because a
  future reader needed the reasoning, not the conclusion. That serves a human
  successor and an agent identically.
- **Do not make it agent-only.** Prose that only a model will parse, or records
  with no human-legible summary, lock out the audience that has to make the
  judgement calls. A `grade-run.sh` verdict a person can read in five seconds is
  not a legacy concession.

## Every session ends by saying where it stopped

A session can end at any moment -- a usage limit, a lost connection, a context
that ran out. So the resume point is written **as the work happens**, not
composed at the end when there may be no end to compose it in.

`plans/PROGRESS.md` is where it lives, because it is the first thing a cold
session reads. Its "Very next step" must always be true *right now*: what is
half-done and where, what is running elsewhere, what was just learned that has
not been acted on, and what the next concrete action is. If a session is
interrupted mid-change, the tree and the dashboard should still agree about what
state the work is in.

The test is simple and worth applying honestly: **if this session ended on the
next tool call, could the following one continue without re-deriving anything?**
If not, the dashboard is behind and updating it is the next action, not the last
one.

This applies to subagents too. An agent that finishes without saying what it
verified, what it could not, and what it left open has produced work the calling
session has to redo.

## A finding that is not in the repository does not exist

Every finding lands in the repository in the session that produced it — as code,
as a test, or as a dated note in the page that owns the subject. This applies
identically to findings made by a subagent: an agent's report is a delivery
mechanism, not a destination, and the reporting session is responsible for
landing it. So is a measurement made in passing while chasing something else.

The failure mode is specific and this session produced it: a device measurement
gets made, gets discussed, informs the next decision, and is then lost when the
conversation moves on — leaving the next session to re-measure it, or worse, to
reason from the stale value still written down.

If a finding cannot be landed now, it is written down as an open item with what
is known and what is missing. "I will do it later in this session" is not a
record. Neither is a number that appears only in a commit message for a change
about something else.

A finding that *contradicts* something already written is the highest priority
of all, because the repository is actively misleading until it is corrected —
correct it in place and keep the original, per the next section.

## `plans/PROGRESS.md` is part of the change, not a chore after it

The dashboard is the only place that says what is actually done, so a commit
that changes package state and leaves it alone has made the repository lie.
Three specific obligations, each of which was violated before it was written:

- **A package's state changes in the same commit as the work.** Its plan's
  result block, its dashboard row, and both headline counts, together. The
  counting rule in `PROGRESS.md` says this for the numerator; it holds equally
  for the state and next-gate columns, which go stale silently because nothing
  recomputes them.
- **The "Very next step" is re-pointed the moment it is finished.** It is the
  first thing a cold session reads. Leaving it pointing at closed work sends the
  next session to redo it.
- **Rows are read off each plan's own completion markers, never from memory.**
  A 2026-08-26 audit found Plan 03's row had been authored stale on the day the
  file was created — its work item 1 had closed two days earlier — and Plan 08
  still carrying a withdrawn refutation that, read literally, closed five open
  packages.

An honest percentage that goes down is worth more than a flattering one: adding
a plan raises the denominator, and that is the number moving correctly.

## Retractions stay

When a result turns out wrong, correct it in place and keep the original
reasoning with a dated note. Several documents here are worth more for their
retractions than their conclusions.

## Checks

```sh
node tools/test.mjs --engine     # about a minute; run on every edit
tools/device/test-query-cue-helper.sh
tools/device/test-soak-cue-helper.sh
```

CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs these three on every push to `master`.
The `--browser` checks stay local: they are graded in real-time milliseconds,
and a loaded shared runner fails them without saying anything about the code.

Device tooling has mock-ADB regressions that never touch a phone. Use them —
they are how a device tool gets tested without a device.
