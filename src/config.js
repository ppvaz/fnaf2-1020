// 120/s figure as **"Nights 6-7"** -- yet it is applied here to every night.
//
// Measured on the phone, Night 1, never winding, sampling the CAM 11 pie every
// ~9 s (captures are local-only; the pie is the white ellipse right of the wind
// button, roughly x 640-850, y 770-900 at 2400x1080):

//     t+133s  0.628   t+160s  0.304   t+188s  0.000
//
// Two disagreements with this file, both mattering to the campaign nights:
//
//   1. The box does not start draining at night start. It held flat for the
//      first ~133 s of Night 1 and only then began falling. The engine has no
//      activation term at all -- `tickBox` drains whenever `opts.boxEnabled`,
//      which is a global option and not a per-night rule.
//   2. Full -> empty took about **55 s**, not 16.67 s -- roughly 36 units/s,
//      a factor of 3.3 slower than this constant.
//
// So Night 1 (and plausibly 2-5) is priced here with a night-6/7 drain running
// from a night-6/7 start time. The direction is pessimistic -- the simulator
// demands more winding than the game does -- which is the safer direction but
// still wrong, and it makes any wind-budget claim below Night 6 unsound.
//
// Caveats on the measurement, so it is not over-read: the pie fraction is not
// known to be linear in counter units, 0.626 may be a saturated "full" rather
// than the true maximum, and the activation time is bracketed only to
// 133-142 s at a 9 s sampling interval. What is not in doubt is the sign and
// the rough magnitude of both disagreements.
//
// ~~NOT YET FIXED. The per-night drain groups have not been located in the dump~~
// **FOUND AND FIXED 2026-08-26. The groups are g653-660**, and they confirm
// both device disagreements above, from source.
//

// shipped game runs the 0 arm, so Night 3 is 60 units/s.

//   2. The values rise monotonically with difficulty (2,2,3,4,4,5,6,6) --

// They are lopsided, and two of them are cliffs rather than slopes. On Android
// every office light is gated on `mask = 0` (g75/g84), so a mask still on when
// the hall flash is due swallows the flash and Foxy is never reset. Only about
// three frames separate the two steps, which is the whole reason `mask-off`
// cannot be late and `flash-hall` cannot be early. Both search winners in
// plan 04 widened exactly that gap.
//
// A window is what the game tolerates on ONE input while everything else is
// perfect. Real play is wrong on every step at once, so grading takes a
// fraction of it rather than the edge.
