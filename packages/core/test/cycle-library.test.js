// --- Prerequisite reachability ------------------------------------------------

// A primitive whose prerequisites no sequence of library primitives can
// establish is dead code: the planner can never legally select it. This is not
// hypothetical. Measured 2026-09-02, driving CycleController cycle by cycle
// over Night 1: `wind-and-anchor` is rejected at 1800/1800 decision boundaries
// for
// `prerequisite:monitor="down" | prerequisite:viewedCamera=null`, the controller
// the controller selects `observe-and-hold` 241 times and nothing else, and
// Night 1 ends `death=puppet` at ~4 AM. No primitive emits a `cam:` action and
// `C.initialCamera(1)` is CAM 09, not `C.BOX_CAM`.
//
// Plan 20 P5's nine-second blackout fixture cannot see this, and the wind gate
// above hand-builds the state the library cannot reach on its own.
