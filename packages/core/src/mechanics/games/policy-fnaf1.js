// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// FNaF 1 policies, written from the published community strategies.
//
// References, both already in this repository:
//
//   - `plans/26-second-target-fnaf-1-3-4.md`: the 4/20 loop is
//     `Left Door Light -> Camera -> Right Door Light -> Camera -> repeat`,
//     dominated by the right door, with Foxy held by camera attention and
//     power discipline as the binding constraint.
//   - `docs/research/FNAF-SENSOR-ABLATION-RUNS.md`: the door lights are not
//     load-bearing -- a public clear exists that replaces the light with
//     continuous camera tracking and pays for it in power -- and the power
//     arithmetic (`usage = 1 + Sigma`, 999 units, ~89 s hours) is confirmed
//     against the dump.
//
// **Every policy here is observation-limited.** It may read a door light
// (which shows whether someone is at that door), a camera (which shows who is
// on it), and the HUD's hour and power. It never reads a position the player
// is not looking at. A policy that consulted simulator state directly would
// win more and mean nothing.
//
// Two things the source says that change how the published loop should be
// played, and that the published accounts do not state:
//
//   1. **Foxy's hold is re-rolled, not accumulated** [SOURCED: g460 sets the
//      timer to `50 + Random(1000)` **every 100 ms** while any camera is up;
//      g445 drains it 1 per frame; g321 needs it at 0]. Each tick *replaces*
//      the value, so dwelling on a camera just re-rolls a hold worth
//      0.83-17.5 s, mean ~9.2 s. A flick buys nearly the same expected hold as
//      a dwell, at a fraction of the power. The loop below therefore flicks.
//
//   2. **Holding a light to watch a shut door is the single most expensive
//      thing a player can do**, because `usage` counts the light and the door
//      separately [SOURCED: g313]. The loop shuts the door for a fixed dwell
//      and re-checks with a flash, rather than watching continuously.

/**
 * The scheduled line: shut each door only across its own roll instants.
 *
 * This is not a community strategy and is not offered as one. It is what the
 * source makes available and the published accounts do not use, and it exists
 * because the community loop cannot afford Night 5: base drain plus the
 * per-night drain [g477-g480] already spends 713 of the 999-unit reserve, and
 * holding a door through a camp costs more than the 286 that remain.
 *
 * The lever is that **a movement roll is on a fixed global timer**, not on
 * anything the player does. `Every 4970 ms` (Bonnie) and `Every 4980 ms`
 * (Chica) load on their first reach and fire at multiples of their period
 * from frame 0 [SOURCED: g318, g319, and `passEvery`], so the instants a door
 * actually has to be shut are known in advance for the whole night. Shutting
 * a door for `windowFrames` frames around each of them costs `windowFrames / 298` of what
 * holding it costs, and nothing else in the night needs it shut.
 *
 * The published loop is the control this is measured against: same simulator,
 * same seeds, same Foxy and Freddy handling, different door discipline.
 *
 * **MODEL ONLY -- this is not a device route, and its score must not be read
 * as one.** The simulator sets `leftDoor` and `rightDoor` independently every
 * frame, with no pan state. The handset says that is impossible: the two
 * doors sit 2779 px apart on a 2400 px screen and are **never both on
 * screen**, so every door press is pan-then-press at the measured 270 ms
 * floor -- a 540 ms round trip.
 *
 * And the two grids start aligned. Both `Every` timers load at t = 0 and the
 * periods differ by only 10 ms, so the instants separate by 10 ms per cycle:
 *
 *   for the first **53 cycles -- 263 s of a 535 s night** -- the two door
 *   instants are closer together than one pan round trip, inside a 333 ms
 *   window.
 *
 * For half of every night a single actuator cannot serve both doors. The
 * 65,536/65,536 below is a true statement about the model and a false one
 * about the phone, which is this repository's oldest failure mode: the
 * simulator prices nothing. `communityLoop` is the actuatable policy --
 * its door shuts are belief-driven and last a whole camp (12-20 s), so a
 * 270 ms pan fits inside its 1 s check cadence with room to spare.
