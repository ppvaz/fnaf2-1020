// FNaF 2's night, expressed in the shared shape.
//
// This file holds **no numbers of its own**. FNaF 2's difficulty table is
// `config.js`'s `AI_BY_NIGHT`, which the live route, every survival figure
// and every graded bundle in this repository are computed against; a second
// copy of it here would be a second thing to keep true. What this adds is the
// clock, which `config.js` states as two derived constants (`NIGHT_FRAMES`,
// `HOUR_FRAMES`) without the groups that produce them, and the translation
// into the cross-game shape so all four games can be asked the same question.
//
// Regenerate the clock with
//   tools/dump/nightmap.py --game fnaf2 --clock

// 1000 ms with the fast-nights global clear and g628 every 500 ms with it
// set; g630 advances the hour at `AM >= 70` and zeroes `AM`; g631 starts the
// hour counter at **12**; g629 wraps 12 to 1; g672 leaves the frame at 6].

// same length: 70 ticks of 1000 ms, and a 6 * 70 = 420 s night. That is
// `config.js`'s `NIGHT_FRAMES = s(420)` and `HOUR_FRAMES = s(70)`, now with
