// The observation-conditioned branch language (Plan 05 package 6b, the half
// Plan 21 package 7's invention campaign needs before it can run).
//
// Plan 21's policy-v1 grammar can only express an unconditional schedule:
// idle/setup/repeat/finish/observe, with `observations` that are recorded and
// never read. Plans 05, 06 and 16 closed the unconditional space by recorded
// negative. What is left is programs that BRANCH on something the controller
// can actually see, so this module defines what "can actually see" means as
// data, not as prose.
//
// Two rules the rest of this file exists to enforce:
//
//  1. A fact may appear in a branch only if the cost of reading it is
//     MEASURED. An unmeasured read cost is `UNKNOWN` and the fact is excluded
//     -- never given a plausible number (PROJECT-CHARTER.md).
//  2. A branch may only demand a decision the measured budget can supply. A
//     branch whose first action starts sooner after its observation than one
//     measured read takes is refused, not rounded down.
//
// This module is a definition and a validator. It claims nothing about whether
// any branch survives a model gate, and nothing about device readiness: every
// fact below is `classifier: 'UNCALIBRATED'` today, so `deviceAdmissibleFacts()`
// is empty and stays empty until Plan 15 lands a calibrated pairing.
